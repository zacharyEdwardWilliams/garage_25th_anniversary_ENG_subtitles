1 
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,500
Could you turn that down?

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry, the wagu I was preparing suddenly ended.

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Good evening, this is Sakuba.

4
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Can you hear me?

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What?

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Today is the 25th anniversary of Garage, so I would like to do it.

7
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The software I use is the Steam version.

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:02:07,000
If you clear it normally, it will end in about 3 or 4 hours, so I would like to read as many lines as possible and fish for my favorite frogs.

9
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Thank you.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Also, if the author does it, I think there are various ways to interpret it.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I hope you don't mind that much and listen to it.

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you.

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, let's get started.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's a new game.

15
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
This is the garage. Please sit there.

16
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I may feel a strong presence at first, but please bear with it.

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Your name is Yan-san, right?

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Well, Yan-san, are you okay?

19
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You don't have to worry about anything.

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Please believe in the garage.

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sure you can get what you want.

22
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's a sea animal.

23
00:03:48,000 --> 00:04:05,000
This is the original version, and after this, various scenes of the game will be played.

24
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's a cut scene.

25
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It has begun.

26
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you ask me to be careful, you may find my shadow.

27
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What is this?

28
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I can't open the door.

29
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Compared to recent games, there is a lot of information.

30
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It's written in the script, but who do you think this is?

31
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is the last part of the story.

32
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'm talking about a big frog at this point.

33
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's a note to confuse the player.

34
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If you can't find the key, it's all over.

35
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You have to live in your past forever.

36
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
A thousand eyes.

37
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I woke up in this room.

38
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Did you wake up?

39
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You were floating in the water.

40
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
When I was about to leave, you walked in front of my house.

41
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I tried to recover, but I couldn't.

42
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
When you read this, you should ask for a chance to start.

43
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
By chance, you washed up in front of my house just as I was about to depart.

44
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I think you'll tell me about adaptability level.

45
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You can recover adaptability at Hall of Adaptation.

46
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
And if you can, get out of this ugly world.

47
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This world is not the right one.

48
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm going to find your shadow.

49
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It all starts there.

50
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
A thousand eyes.

51
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I don't know if it's on the right side or the left side.

52
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It's relative.

53
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I think most people will start to get lost after this.

54
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's a problem that keeps following me.

55
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
If you forget to write, I don't care if you use the bin door in the room freely.

56
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There's nothing we can do about the crab in this world.

57
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:53,000
People in the first place don't know what they're saying.

58
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Please repair this.

59
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Broken Orgolt and Shenmue.

60
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Sleeves out.

61
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Bind.

62
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,000
This mobile phone back gas is an item that has been added since it was completely banned.

63
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It is said that there was no mobile phone in the original version.

64
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It is kind.

65
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:12,000
This is also a guide to where to put it out during development.

66
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's go to Hajime's place.

67
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Hajime, you are missing.

68
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The level of purity is decreasing.

69
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
It is better to fix it quickly.

70
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It is to go to the level of purity.

71
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If you pass by too much in front of your house from here, you will see a woodshed.

72
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
If you move from the woodshed to the front, there is a level of purity.

73
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If you talk to the receptionist, you will be able to do something.

74
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There is a level of purity.

75
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
If you talk to the receptionist, you will be able to do something.

76
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The level of purity is to pass by too much in front of your house and go to the front of the woodshed.

77
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
This is also not possible to go to the left.

78
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It has been completely tutorialized.

79
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,000
At first, there were a lot of people who died because they could not reach Junro Island.

80
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I lost it because I wanted to make it a tutorial.

81
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Originally, there was a lot of movement there.

82
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
For example, if you know the new world, you can go to this state.

83
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
At that time, there was also a chain service.

84
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
At first, I decided to go to Junro Island quietly.

85
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I could only go in a certain direction.

86
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:09,640
Can you hear the Tic-Tac

87
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
You are taking care of your duty.

88
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Will you fix it?

89
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Do you have angangenist stamp?

90
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
50 relief boards.

91
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
20 120 boards.

92
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sorry.

93
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Explain.

94
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What do you want to do?

95
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's a pure energy recovery device.

96
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
The rotating treatment device is the official name, but everyone calls it a wooden board.

97
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know what a wooden board means, but it used to be called that before I knew it.

98
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Music and mechanical vibration recover pure energy.

99
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Pure energy recovery device.

100
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Pure energy is recovered by a special liquid called pure energy.

101
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I think everyone thinks this, but wooden boards and pure energy are the same.

102
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
So why is it there?

103
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Maybe that's it.

104
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I like that kind of thing.

105
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I like it, but in the end, I just want to ride a wooden board.

106
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I want to get into a pure energy recovery device, but I just want to get into a pure energy recovery device.

107
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I like games with that kind of choice.

108
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
The effect is the same.

109
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Your scent.

110
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This is the explanation of this gauge.

111
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It shows how much pure energy you have.

112
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
For example, if it were me, I would be able to sell various parts in the name of Gimnon.

113
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:04,000
The fact that pure energy decreases means that Gimnon becomes something that is not Gimnon.

114
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Gimnon becomes weak as an adhesive.

115
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Then the reason for connecting the parts will be lost.

116
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
And in the end, it will be disassembled.

117
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Pure energy, pure energy recovery device.

118
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
When the pure energy is reduced, you can't talk.

119
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I call that state pure energy recovery device.

120
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Before that happens, you can recover it with pure energy or pure energy.

121
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And the only thing that comes after the sound is the arm.

122
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
If you have no arm, your arm will stop talking and you won't be able to do any more detailed work.

123
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You won't be able to set a record, so you should recover it immediately.

124
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
White gas.

125
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I like it because it's cute.

126
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's cute.

127
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Number 5.

128
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You have a red and blue gauge on your body, right?

129
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The blue one is the fuel system.

130
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
White gas is supplied from the machine.

131
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Our machine can't generate white gas.

132
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The machine can send crabs and frogs and turn them into white gas.

133
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Our belly is an air tank, but the other belly is a white gas manufacturer.

134
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
If you go to a white gas factory, you can save.

135
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And the machine.

136
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You probably don't understand what I'm saying at first glance.

137
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The feature of our machine is that it has a high output.

138
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The engine is large, and it is also good for fishing and transportation.

139
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The head is a fuel tank, and the belly is an air tank for compressed air.

140
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The compressed air can be made with a compressor that connects to the engine.

141
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The body of each part is driven by this compressed air.

142
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
However, the range of movement is limited so that you can't create your own white gas.

143
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If there is a suspicious output axis, it is a machine that can only be pushed.

144
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
If you use this machine, you can drive small aircraft and ships.

145
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
But the most important thing is to control the belly of the machine.

146
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This is an essential step in producing white gas.

147
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
And the machine.

148
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The feature of the machine is that you can produce white gas by eating crabs and crabs.

149
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The large belly is a white gas manufacturer, and the white gas produced is stored in the chest.

150
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The stored white gas can be used as your fuel or supplied through a pump to the machine.

151
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
The rest of the white gas produced is disposed as water.

152
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The head is an air tank.

153
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:17,000
However, the engine is small overall, so it is suitable for work that requires high output.

154
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can't read the chat.

155
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Please wait a moment.

156
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Chat.

157
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Chat.

158
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I can't read the chat.

159
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Well, let's recover.

160
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
No. 1, Mokuba.

161
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Mokuba.

162
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Then, please bring the rotating treatment device to the other side of the road you just passed.

163
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
This movie.

164
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
This.

165
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
There is a frame of the building in front of you.

166
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:42,000
This is all handwritten and attached to the front of the original movie to make the movie.

167
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm doing rough work.

168
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, what should I do?

169
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Well.

170
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Well.

171
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Honda.

172
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Honda.

173
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What? As you can see, I made a stand.

174
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It's attached to your body, too, right?

175
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Yes, that's the stand.

176
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But I'm in trouble.

177
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The track on the front is gone.

178
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I can't read that the wheels can't be added to the front.

179
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I wonder if there is a replacement track somewhere.

180
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Even if it's a track on the front, maybe.

181
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:44,000
If you have a track that you can use somewhere, would you bring it to me?

182
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
All right.

183
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Thank you.

184
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
This.

185
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This is the track on the left side of Babuchan.

186
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This is the track.

187
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This is the track I drew with my handwritten for this complete version.

188
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
This is. . .

189
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
How should I put it?

190
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There is a rotating shaft on the side.

191
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
In it. . .

192
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
In general, the material that becomes the rotating body. . .

193
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The track is for adding the material.

194
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
That track is broken.

195
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
So. . .

196
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I can't use this.

197
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Honda, this is a stand.

198
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I think there are a lot of small circles around here.

199
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
This is the wheel.

200
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
In addition to this. . .

201
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm going to make a deep circle.

202
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm in trouble because I can't do that.

203
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm saying.

204
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Bring it to me.

205
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What?

206
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What?

207
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
N-san.

208
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I like things that I don't understand.

209
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
For example, wood.

210
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Why is it called wood even though no one knows it?

211
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
It's a strange story.

212
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
There is something called something that I have never seen or heard of.

213
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Maybe it's not here.

214
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It must be somewhere.

215
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
By the way.

216
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If you find something that you don't understand.

217
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Just tell me your name.

218
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
This. . .

219
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I received the most difficult garage quest.

220
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh, and. . .

221
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Maybe it's about fishing.

222
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:14,480
The basic to do in this world is to catch the marine

223
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
I didn't have it.

224
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,480
I don't like stamps.

225
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,480
If you change the crab, you can change it.

226
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
What is it?

227
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,480
It was a character that could be remodeled.

228
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,480
To make a complete version.

229
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:05,480
With a strong will to make all the characters stand.

230
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,480
I made a lot of scenarios.

231
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
At that time.

232
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,480
It's a shape that has changed completely.

233
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
Yunmu.

234
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
Pushke.

235
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,480
Ask for the first time.

236
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
It's an old press machine.

237
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,480
It's next to your house.

238
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
By the way, you don't look.

239
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
But. . .

240
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
No one cares about that.

241
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,480
This is such a place.

242
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,480
Be careful with the press machine.

243
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
If you get in there, you'll be crushed and it's over.

244
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,480
It's written as a stand-in.

245
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Why did you make a press machine?

246
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Yunmu.

247
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,480
It's a mysterious character.

248
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Miyasan.

249
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,480
A lot of people who don't talk.

250
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
Crab.

251
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,480
Sometimes you want to eat frogs.

252
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,480
But it's better than crab.

253
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,480
You have to catch the press machine after all.

254
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,480
You guys bring crabs and frogs.

255
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,480
We eat it and change it to white gas.

256
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,480
First of all, you're the one who thinks about yourself first.

257
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,480
If you want to be happy, you'll be a great fisherman.

258
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,480
The important thing is to catch.

259
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,480
Frogs are delicious.

260
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,480
It's really delicious.

261
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,480
The delicious thing about frogs is that you're not a crab.

262
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,480
The crab is dry.

263
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
And the shell is hard.

264
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,480
The jaw will be strong.

265
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,480
It's said that there's a rare frog in the fishing spot behind the house.

266
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,480
I don't know what you can catch.

267
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,480
Let's go to the fishing spot.

268
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,480
I'm free. I'm free.

269
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,480
I can do anything.

270
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,480
I'm glad I'm a fisherman.

271
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,480
I'll teach you how to fish.

272
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,480
It's a kind game.

273
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
It's your first time, isn't it?

274
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,480
If so, I'll give you a small hook and a small bait.

275
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,480
I'll give you this.

276
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,480
A fishing rod.

277
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,480
A 15x10 and a stinger.

278
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,480
I'll give you a fishing rod.

279
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,480
I'll give you a fishing rod.

280
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,480
To start fishing, first say hello to the surface of the water.

281
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,480
Then you can choose the hook and the bait.

282
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,480
You don't have to think about the fishing rod now.

283
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Once you've decided on the hook and the bait,

284
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Start fishing and wait for the frog to eat the bait.

285
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,480
When the frog eats the bait, the core trembles.

286
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Touch the right handle and hook the frog.

287
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,480
Just a little touch is fine.

288
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,480
You can see how much strength there is when the frog is hooked on the hook.

289
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,480
All you have to do is pull it up and pull it up until the frog loses its strength.

290
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,480
What you have to be careful about is the tension of the thread.

291
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
When the core goes up, it's pulled.

292
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,480
When the core goes down, the thread is loosened.

293
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,480
If the thread is too tight or too loose, the frog will run away.

294
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,480
So this core doesn't go up and down.

295
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Pull it up while operating the handle.

296
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,480
The handle can be moved up and down and the thread can be wound or loosened.

297
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,480
Only when the handle is at the bottom of the middle, the frog can breathe.

298
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,480
What should I do to open it?

299
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,480
I'll explain it again.

300
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,480
You can't understand this even if you listen to it in words.

301
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,480
When I watch the live video of people who are not good at fishing,

302
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,480
I'm always looking at it while I'm hungry.

303
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:22,480
And now...

304
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,480
Oh, this isn't it.

305
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Let's talk about fishing.

306
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,480
First of all, the basic of fishing is to hook a rod.

307
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,480
If you use a rod to catch a frog's food, you can catch a crab.

308
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,480
If you don't have food, you can't fish.

309
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,480
So you should be careful not to hook a rod.

310
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,480
If you hook a rod with a rod, you should definitely use a hook.

311
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,480
If it's a gold mark, you'll get twice as much crab.

312
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,480
No matter how small the rod is, it won't hurt.

313
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
I always buy it at the convenience store when the hook is gone.

314
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,480
I'll give you this, so try it.

315
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Use it.

316
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,480
To hook a gold mark on the hook.

317
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,480
I'll get a lot.

318
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,480
Then...

319
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm going to fish.

320
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,480
I can run away.

321
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,480
I can see the timing to run away.

322
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,480
Oh, this is rust.

323
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,480
I'll get a lot.

324
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,480
All the paths are clear.

325
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,480
If you have 21 of them,

326
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,480
You can clear all the events.

327
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,480
I'll get some rust.

328
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,980
乗せ入?

329
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,100
I came to play with anteater.

330
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,640
Will you come to the foundation?

331
00:27:45,480 --> 00:28:09,380
Why is it designed like this?

332
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:19,380
I was thinking about what to buy because there was a sale of goods at a place called Village Vanguard.

333
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:33,380
It was decided quite a bit here, but I wanted to put a gate, but I removed it because I didn't think I could buy it.

334
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,380
Rusty frog.

335
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:54,380
Also, there is a place called Gedo-ga Otamajaku facility, but I wonder what it will be like.

336
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,380
Oh, Okibi is here.

337
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:00,380
300 yen.

338
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:19,380
Do you want a key to open Gedo?

339
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:41,380
There are quite a few things that you can make these days, such as accessories and T-shirts.

340
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,380
How many did you get? About 5 more?

341
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,380
I want a lot more than before.

342
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:19,380
I think it's a good idea to make it so that there is almost no standing scissors.

343
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:33,380
This game has a great range of random frogs, so it's interesting.

344
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:39,380
I've collected all the Gedo with the first 10 in the test play.

345
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:50,380
When Rea comes, it feels like Rea is approaching.

346
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,380
Oh, Okibi is here again.

347
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:58,380
This is quite ...

348
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,380
I wonder if I should make a record.

349
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:29,380
Compared to the background, the resolution is high if you only play the character.

350
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:54,380
I don't care if I'm doing it on my smartphone, but the resolution of the original screen is 640 x 480, and I did it with the resolution of the base when I made the complete version this time.

351
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:22,380
It's been a while since I wanted to make it beautiful, but maybe I couldn't play the game if I changed the resolution to high resolution.

352
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:41,380
This tree part is almost hand-drawn, or it's completely drawn with Photoshop, so it takes a lot of effort to raise the resolution.

353
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:48,380
I wonder how many Gedo I've collected.

354
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:54,380
I've collected 20 Gedo, so I'll collect one more.

355
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:09,380
I've collected a lot of Gedo, so I'll collect one more Gedo.

356
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,380
That's right. It's only Photoshop.

357
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,380
This is only Photoshop.

358
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:40,380
In some original versions, the height of the water surface was not successful, and the water surface was higher.

359
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,380
That's right.

360
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:52,380
It's the same with the back of the house, but in reality, the height of the boat must be the same.

361
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:57,380
I wanted to make it better, so I rewrote everything.

362
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:59,380
It's like that.

363
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,380
I don't know how many places.

364
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,380
I don't think most of the players notice it.

365
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,380
It's not right. The height is not right.

366
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,380
I wanted to fix it all the time if I made a mistake.

367
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,380
There are a few places.

368
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,380
I brought it.

369
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
What you have is a geido.

370
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:29,380
I only eat crabs here.

371
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,380
Would you like to sell me a geido?

372
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,380
You are a kind boy.

373
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
It's a good deal.

374
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:42,380
In the old days, I used to have a white horse every time I went to work.

375
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:45,380
It's nostalgic.

376
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:00,380
Let's fix it with a ball.

377
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,380
I know.

378
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,380
He is different.

379
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,380
It's soft.

380
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,380
It's like smoke.

381
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:29,380
There was such a guy in the old days.

382
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:32,380
I don't know much about it these days.

383
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,380
Pusika is close to Yan.

384
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,380
Yan is the master of Shirogaseya.

385
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,380
If you are the leader of Shirogaseya second high school, you may know something more.

386
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,380
It's a second high school.

387
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,380
There is also a timetable.

388
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,380
Especially the people of the department store are moving on the timetable.

389
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,380
I have to go to that time.

390
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,380
It's on the wall when you go to Seiryusou.

391
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,380
That's the timetable.

392
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,380
There is also a round meter on the right side of your body.

393
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,380
You can check the time of labor.

394
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,380
It is also a guide to the time of purchase.

395
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,380
It's convenient.

396
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,380
OK.

397
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,380
Let's see.

398
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,380
First of all.

399
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:40,380
OK.

400
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:46,380
This area is rough as it is.

401
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,380
This area is rough as it is.

402
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,380
This area is rough as it is.

403
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,380
There are many traces and traces.

404
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,380
There are traces and traces.

405
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,380
There are traces and traces.

406
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,380
There are traces and traces.

407
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:14,380
Some traces and traces.

408
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,380
I left a few.

409
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:21,380
When I run out of all the boxes, I feel lonely and I leave a lot of them.

410
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,380
The time is just right now.

411
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,380
What time is it?

412
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,380
It's time to go to the TROP.

413
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,380
TROP

414
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,380
What is it? PUSHKE?

415
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,380
Who is it?

416
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,380
As you can see, I'm collecting printed goods.

417
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,380
Printed goods are good.

418
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,380
It's not scary.

419
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,380
It's lively.

420
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,380
That's right. If you find a foster,

421
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:53,380
Bring it to me.

422
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,380
I won't let you do that.

423
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:57,380
Did you find something unusual?

424
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,380
Did you find something unusual?

425
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,380
Even here, suddenly...

426
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,380
Even here, suddenly...

427
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,380
Where should I go?

428
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,380
I can get a window.

429
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,380
It's good to exchange it right away.

430
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:15,380
It's good to exchange it right away.

431
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,380
Let's stop this.

432
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,380
Let's exchange the letters.

433
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,380
What is this?

434
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,380
It's gone.

435
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:45,380
PUSHKE, I don't know.

436
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,380
I don't want to know anything.

437
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,380
I don't want to know anything.

438
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,380
I'm tired today.

439
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,380
I'm tired today.

440
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,380
I shouldn't be tired.

441
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,380
I shouldn't be tired.

442
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,380
Because if I get tired, I can't work.

443
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,380
But I have something to do.

444
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,380
I don't want to get tired.

445
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,380
Because I'm glad I have something to do.

446
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,380
It's just a little bit.

447
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,380
I'm really PUSHKE.

448
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,380
I'm really PUSHKE.

449
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,380
I was scared.

450
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,380
I don't know everything.

451
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,380
I don't know everything.

452
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,860
Let's go to the

453
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,860
entrance.

454
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,860
Let's go to the entrance.

455
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,860
Let's go home.

456
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,860
I think it's an orgel.

457
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,860
Can you show me a little?

458
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,860
This is definitely my work.

459
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,860
I see.

460
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,860
But the damage is terrible.

461
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,860
The gears are rattling.

462
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,860
I'll fix it.

463
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,860
I don't need a stamp.

464
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,860
That's right.

465
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,860
Please come back in three weeks.

466
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,860
Please come back.

467
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,860
I gave you a broken orgel.

468
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:18,100
I think someone who has heard of blocks

469
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,100
will know.

470
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,700
I beaucoup

471
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,700
are told

472
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
that this is the night of

473
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:27,700
alma mater.

474
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,700
I think it was

475
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,420
Can A shaman was

476
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,420
one of those happened

477
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,420
three times.

478
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,420
It is indeed

479
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,420
that I am a

480
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:48,420
It's like riding the railroad with the experiment of the professor.

481
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:55,420
In the final school, it's all deleted.

482
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:00,420
It's like becoming a dream of Jopany.

483
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:09,420
When I made this game, there were no people who knew that it was the third accident.

484
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:15,420
At one time, I was thinking about doing something like a book on the silver test.

485
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,420
There was a time when I was doing a little painting, and I was looking at various things.

486
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:28,420
I thought it was okay to use the name of the person who made this kind of thing, but it became very famous.

487
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:34,420
I was a little disappointed that it became a name that would be found out immediately.

488
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,420
This is the third time.

489
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,420
Tsuruga 21, Tachibasami 9.

490
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,420
A little more.

491
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,420
This?

492
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:58,420
I can't pass this.

493
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:15,420
I'm trying to read as many lines as possible.

494
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,420
Chiyo, do you know Pusike?

495
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,420
Pusike is a shadow.

496
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,420
A shadow is like a tattoo.

497
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,420
If anyone has it, it's that tattoo.

498
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,420
You may still have it.

499
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,420
No, I'm sure.

500
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:34,420
But the shadow will eventually disappear.

501
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,420
It will disappear.

502
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:38,420
You should hurry.

503
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,420
If that happens, everything will be over.

504
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:42,420
I can't go back again.

505
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:44,420
Where?

506
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:46,420
Everywhere.

507
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:58,420
I want to read as many lines as possible, so I wonder if I should go to the New World.

508
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,420
Don't worry.

509
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,420
Don't worry.

510
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,420
Follow me.

511
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,420
I can kill me.

512
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:07,420
What's wrong with killing me?

513
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:12,420
I want to go to the New World.

514
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,420
I want to go to the New World.

515
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,420
I want to go to the New World.

516
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,420
What should I do?

517
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,420
I'll go.

518
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,420
I'll go.

519
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,420
I'll go.

520
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:47,420
Riz, is this your first time?

521
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,420
Please open the door to my stomach first.

522
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,420
Yes.

523
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,420
Next, put your output axis in my stomach and expand it.

524
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:59,420
It's hard to say an output axis.

525
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:05,420
Thank you very much.

526
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:15,420
If I go here, the quest will start now, so I won't go yet.

527
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:23,420
Then...

528
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,420
I will go to the New World all of a sudden.

529
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:40,420
I will go to the New World all of a sudden.

530
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:56,420
I will go to the New World all of a sudden.

531
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,420
I will go to the New World all of a sudden.

532
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,420
I didn't read the lines.

533
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:06,420
I didn't read the lines.

534
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,420
I will go to the New World all of a sudden.

535
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,420
I should have listened to the explanation.

536
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,420
I didn't say anything.

537
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:37,420
I didn't say anything.

538
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,420
Then...

539
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,420
I will go to the New World all of a sudden.

540
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,420
I will go to the New World all of a sudden.

541
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,420
This...

542
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:13,420
This number is there, isn't it?

543
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,420
This is...

544
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:20,420
This is the date I decided on this number.

545
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:22,420
I read it from the other side.

546
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:25,420
It's December 12, 1998.

547
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:31,420
I was wondering what number to choose, so I decided on this number.

548
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,420
So...

549
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,420
26 years ago?

550
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,420
About a month ago.

551
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,420
At this point, when I go to the New World...

552
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,420
There is also a rare poster.

553
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:03,420
This is interesting.

554
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:17,420
Which one was this?

555
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:19,420
Was it this?

556
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,420
Bindochuga.

557
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,420
I didn't say anything.

558
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,420
Train device.

559
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:52,420
This is my world.

560
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,420
This is my world.

561
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:54,420
This is my world.

562
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,420
This is my world.

563
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:56,420
This is my world.

564
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,420
This is my world.

565
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,420
I'm happy.

566
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:01,420
But who is he?

567
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,420
11 years old.

568
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,420
Chen is here.

569
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:19,420
Chen, who are you?

570
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,420
I see.

571
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:24,420
You've changed a lot.

572
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,420
What the hell is this place?

573
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,420
It's the same up to here.

574
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:32,420
It's strange.

575
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,420
Are you crazy?

576
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:36,420
You've changed a lot.

577
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,420
Or have you all forgotten?

578
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,420
It's a good thing.

579
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,420
Chen has an aural scope on his eyes.

580
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,420
I don't know if I'm wearing it.

581
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:53,420
I'm wearing it.

582
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,420
A device that can interact with shadows.

583
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,420
Can you see this?

584
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,420
This is it.

585
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:08,420
You probably feel the presence of the protagonist.

586
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,420
That's the kind of setting.

587
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:15,420
I'm just saying that it depends on how you use it.

588
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,420
What should I do?

589
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:23,420
I can do a lot of things when I go.

590
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,420
I'll go a little later.

591
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,420
I don't care about the lines.

592
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:38,420
If you go to the fishing spot ahead, you can catch a lot of unusual fish.

593
00:49:38,420 --> 00:49:40,420
It's too unfair.

594
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,420
Let's stop.

595
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,420
I'm sorry.

596
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:58,420
Every time the show changes, all the lines change.

597
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:03,420
You can understand Chen's sub-story.

598
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,420
I'm sure everyone who wants to play knows this.

599
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:11,420
It's not a suicide, but it disappears.

600
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:16,420
You can read the background of the story.

601
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,420
This is a text for the second week.

602
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:28,420
I don't think it's touched much in the play.

603
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:35,420
I want to make it a delivery where you can read various lines.

604
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:52,420
I bought it for 2,000 yen.

605
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,420
2,000 yen?

606
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:13,420
I bought it for 2,000 yen.

607
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,420
What else?

608
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,420
Tokusan Adaptability Station?

609
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,420
Where is it?

610
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:34,420
Let me ask you a question.

611
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:39,420
Adaptability Station will restore our Adaptability-do as its name implies.

612
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:42,420
Adaptability Station is made of water.

613
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:45,420
Water is a waste material.

614
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,420
But everything was born from this water.

615
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:54,420
Adaptability Station is a place where only a part of the power of this water is produced and cultivated.

616
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:56,420
It's a story I've heard.

617
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,420
I'll buy only one.

618
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:08,420
I'll buy Adaptability Station because I'll use one.

619
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,420
I'm scared.

620
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,420
I'll buy only one.

621
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:50,420
I think it's made of porcelain.

622
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,420
It's done.

623
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:13,420
I'll give you a piece of porcelain.

624
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:17,420
I got a porcelain of alcohol and vulcanic acid.

625
00:53:20,420 --> 00:53:23,420
Is Honda's track broken?

626
00:53:23,420 --> 00:53:25,420
That's a problem, isn't it?

627
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,420
That's right.

628
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,420
I have one more track.

629
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,420
Take this.

630
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:32,420
I got a track.

631
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:35,420
I told you about the track earlier.

632
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,420
This is it.

633
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:42,420
I'm going to put this on the side.

634
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:48,420
It's 90 degrees.

635
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,420
I'm going to put it on the side and stick it to the track.

636
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:54,420
The bottom is the shaft.

637
00:53:54,420 --> 00:54:01,420
I'm going to put the gravel in the place where the upper three nails are attached and turn it.

638
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:05,420
This is a three-nail track.

639
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:13,420
I'm going to put a jack handle in the square hole here and turn it around.

640
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:22,420
This is a mechanism that allows the nails to open and close.

641
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:32,420
The track is made of porcelain, so the real thing is also at home.

642
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:43,420
It seems that it is a little confusing whether Honda is using a three-nail track or not.

643
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:46,420
I got a large car.

644
00:54:57,420 --> 00:55:00,420
The gas has decreased.

645
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:13,420
The amount of white gas is about four and a half laps per lap in the first initial state.

646
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:17,420
It hasn't changed from the original version.

647
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:26,420
Some people have a lot of gas blood, but if it's not this much, the game balance won't work until the second half.

648
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,420
I got a track.

649
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:31,420
Did you really look for it?

650
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:34,420
I'm glad you found it.

651
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:38,420
Brother, I'll adjust your car.

652
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,420
The car has improved by 15%.

653
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:51,420
If you have a rear-wheel-drive and a spoke car, you can improve the performance.

654
00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:54,420
Unfortunately, the stock has run out.

655
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,420
If you find these, bring them.

656
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:01,420
I got a large car with two parts.

657
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:07,420
Let's get a spoke car.

658
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:17,420
My people are happy when they have a large car, so they always think about the large car and touch it.

659
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,420
Bring this.

660
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,420
I got a spoke car.

661
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:27,420
I hid it because I didn't want to talk about it.

662
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:30,420
It can't be helped.

663
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,420
It's a secret that I got it.

664
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:45,420
Let's get a spoke car.

665
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:56,420
Let's get a spoke car.

666
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,420
Let's get a spoke car.

667
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:08,420
Let's get a spoke car.

668
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:23,420
Let's get a spoke car.

669
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:26,420
Let's get a spoke car.

670
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:37,420
I haven't decided what route to take yet.

671
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:43,420
What should I do?

672
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:51,420
I got a spoke car.

673
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,420
Let's get a spoke car.

674
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:02,420
I don't know how long it will take to read the lines.

675
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:11,420
If it doesn't take that long, I'll do two endings.

676
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:17,420
If it takes a long time, I'll go to the juice route.

677
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,420
Let's get a spoke car.

678
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:24,420
Let's get a spoke car.

679
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:33,420
Everyone is wondering.

680
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:36,420
I'm sorry.

681
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,420
I'm sorry.

682
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,420
I should have been careful with my own juice route.

683
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,420
I'm glad I didn't get a spoke car.

684
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,420
What's the matter?

685
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:14,420
It's a good time.

686
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,420
There are female and male.

687
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:20,420
There is no place that is not here.

688
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:23,420
I like this line.

689
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:29,420
It's not here.

690
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:37,420
It's a story that's not here.

691
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:50,420
It's a story that's not here.

692
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:02,420
I want to meet Ha-san and Ta-san.

693
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,420
Between 7 and 12 o'clock.

694
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,420
It's open.

695
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,420
It's open.

696
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:24,420
I did it.

697
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,420
Ha-san, do you have an eraser?

698
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,420
It feels good to know your age.

699
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:30,420
I can erase anything.

700
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:32,420
Why don't you give me an eraser?

701
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,420
It's mean.

702
01:00:33,420 --> 01:00:36,420
Everyone has an eraser in their stomach.

703
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,420
The eraser is closed.

704
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,420
This line is that.

705
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:44,420
I'm old.

706
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:49,420
It's one of the things that I don't understand.

707
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:55,420
So I'll aim for Ta-san.

708
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,420
How many are there in all?

709
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:03,420
There are six.

710
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:08,420
It's really hard to clear the quest.

711
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:13,420
Two of them will disappear here.

712
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:16,420
That's Ha-san.

713
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,420
I'm working at the factory.

714
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:21,420
I'll go see you later.

715
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:25,420
The other one is Ta-san.

716
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,420
The time they are.

717
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:36,420
They're working at the factory from 12 to 7 o'clock.

718
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:39,420
From 7 o'clock to 0 o'clock.

719
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,420
Time in the room.

720
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:45,420
They come here at the time they are in the room.

721
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:50,420
It's a cooling room, so if there's anyone I want to see,

722
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,420
They all come to the time they are in the room.

723
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:59,420
For example, in Jirobei, it's about 9 o'clock from 7 o'clock.

724
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:03,420
Yoshibei is from 9 o'clock to 1 o'clock.

725
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:06,420
That's what it is.

726
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:08,420
They're coming.

727
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,420
Ta-san, come here.

728
01:02:14,420 --> 01:02:16,420
They're gone.

729
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:21,420
Otakasu.

730
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:25,420
This line...

731
01:02:25,420 --> 01:02:28,420
This line here...

732
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:31,420
Sometimes I don't know who's who.

733
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,420
I'm who I am.

734
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:36,420
This line...

735
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,420
It changes every day.

736
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,420
Takashi, turn off the sound.

737
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,420
It's gone.

738
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,420
Takashi is half.

739
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:55,420
I want to hear Ta-san's.

740
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,420
Tako-peya.

741
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:03,420
That's right.

742
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,420
Well, with this...

743
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:11,420
How many lines is this line?

744
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:15,420
It's about 5 or 6 lines, but...

745
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:23,420
The three factories will be gone soon.

746
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:26,420
If you come early,

747
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:30,420
you can relax.

748
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:37,420
I'll wait one more time.

749
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,420
A little more.

750
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:54,420
7 o'clock.

751
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,420
If you go back, the lines...

752
01:03:58,420 --> 01:04:01,420
It's a random line, but...

753
01:04:01,420 --> 01:04:03,420
It comes out a lot, so...

754
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:07,420
If you're interested, it's not that hard.

755
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,420
You again.

756
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,420
Ta-san, come here.

757
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:23,420
They're here.

758
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:25,420
Wait a minute.

759
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,420
Oh, no.

760
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:34,420
I can only say the same thing.

761
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:39,420
He only says it.

762
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,420
Oh, no.

763
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:44,420
Oh, no.

764
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:46,420
It was dangerous.

765
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,420
I'm kidding.

766
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:54,420
Well, let's do it later.

767
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,420
I'm going to the factory.

768
01:05:01,420 --> 01:05:03,420
I can't hold it.

769
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,420
I want to go to Fukujusou, too.

770
01:05:26,420 --> 01:05:28,420
I have to change the window.

771
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:33,420
It's a drop time.

772
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:35,420
I'm going to the factory.

773
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:57,420
Oh, it was a platform.

774
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,420
Great.

775
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:06,420
The blue flag is going up.

776
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:10,420
I'm going up.

777
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,420
Well...

778
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:26,420
It's time to go to the factory.

779
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,420
Pusike.

780
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,420
Pusike is light.

781
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,420
Horrifying light.

782
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:33,420
It disappears.

783
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:40,420
You may wonder why I'm so scared of fushiketsu when I become a kouhai.

784
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:44,420
When the time comes, I'll work hard, and when the time comes, I'll come back.

785
01:06:44,420 --> 01:06:45,420
That's all.

786
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:57,420
It was just the time to be in this room.

787
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:06,420
It was the time to be in this room.

788
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:20,420
The song of the seiryusou was added after it became a complete version.

789
01:07:21,420 --> 01:07:23,420
You are already here.

790
01:07:23,420 --> 01:07:26,420
Fuhi, Fuhi, Fuhi, Fuhi, Fuhi, Fuhi, Fuhi, Fuhi, Fuhi, Fuhi.

791
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,420
Fuhi, I'll give you this.

792
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:30,420
I got a bearing.

793
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:32,420
That Fuhi is not unusual.

794
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,420
I gathered my consciousness.

795
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,420
I'll explain my work.

796
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:47,420
What is it?

797
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:57,420
It's a person from the hell.

798
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:00,420
Here is a vibration device.

799
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:02,420
The vibration is the water.

800
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:04,420
The water is separated by the tank.

801
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:07,420
The heavy thing is below.

802
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,420
The lighter thing is above.

803
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,420
The larger thing is above the net.

804
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:14,420
The smaller thing is below the net.

805
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:16,420
I repeat it over and over again.

806
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:19,420
The color of the water changes.

807
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,420
It becomes transparent.

808
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:23,420
It becomes black.

809
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,420
Parts come out.

810
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,420
It's like a tank.

811
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,420
It's like a plate.

812
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:31,420
It's like a stick.

813
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:33,420
It's like a board.

814
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,420
I don't understand it well.

815
01:08:35,420 --> 01:08:37,420
I'll explain my work.

816
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:40,420
This is a vibration device.

817
01:08:40,420 --> 01:08:44,420
It is a device that can be separated from the top to the bottom.

818
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:50,420
This is the earth.

819
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,420
This is the water and the water.

820
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:01,420
I'll put it together.

821
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:04,420
It's a combination of everything.

822
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,420
Various things come together.

823
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:09,420
Sometimes it's rough.

824
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,420
Sometimes it's rough.

825
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:13,420
Sometimes it's light.

826
01:09:13,420 --> 01:09:15,420
Sometimes it's heavy.

827
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,420
Sometimes it's sticky.

828
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:19,420
I've been watching it all the time.

829
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,420
When it's heavy,

830
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:23,420
Lighten the gear ratio of the pump.

831
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:25,420
When it's light,

832
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,420
Make the gear ratio of the pump heavier.

833
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,420
I've been watching it all the time.

834
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:35,420
I can't control myself.

835
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,420
I can't control myself.

836
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:39,420
The ship runs ahead.

837
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:41,420
I'm dragged out.

838
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,420
I'm dragged out.

839
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:45,420
It's a good thing.

840
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:47,420
When the signal is hot,

841
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:49,420
I'll read it with my head.

842
01:10:01,420 --> 01:10:03,420
I think it's still there.

843
01:10:05,420 --> 01:10:07,420
I don't think it's there.

844
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:15,420
My mother...

845
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:17,420
My mother is gone.

846
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:21,420
I'll listen to my mother's work.

847
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,420
I'll listen to my mother's work.

848
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,420
I'll be right back.

849
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,420
I'll drink some water.

850
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:37,420
I'll drink some water.

851
01:10:43,420 --> 01:10:45,420
I'm back.

852
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,420
Mr.

853
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:51,420
Mr.

854
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:53,420
Mr.

855
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,420
Mr.

856
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:57,420
Mr.

857
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,420
Mr.

858
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:01,420
Mr.

859
01:11:01,420 --> 01:11:03,420
Mr.

860
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:05,420
There's no harm in choosing of the impure.

861
01:11:05,420 --> 01:11:09,420
There's no harm in choosing of the impure.

862
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,420
I know impure things.

863
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,420
I know impure rare things.

864
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:15,420
I know impure rare things.

865
01:11:15,420 --> 01:11:17,420
You know I know impure things.

866
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:19,420
You don't know what impure things are.

867
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,420
You don't know what impure things are.

868
01:11:21,420 --> 01:11:23,420
What I know is impure.

869
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:25,420
I don't know if it's rare or not.

870
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,420
Deep.

871
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:53,420
Well, I don't know what to say, but when I'm setting up a garage or writing a story or a line, I don't do it on purpose.

872
01:11:53,420 --> 01:12:05,420
I feel like I'm just looking at what's right and what's wrong.

873
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:09,420
I think there are probably people who make things like that.

874
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:13,420
I don't know why, but I know this is right.

875
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:19,420
It's just like Taa-san, who just follows it.

876
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:22,420
For the time being, the goal has been achieved.

877
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:42,420
I think there are some people who think that the story is made as intended.

878
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:53,420
Rather, it is often said that the story that is made in a place away from the thread is a good story.

879
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:59,420
I want to go to Fukujusou, but I'm a little confused.

880
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:01,420
Let's share it once.

881
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:18,420
Is the balance between the voice and the game sound okay?

882
01:13:23,420 --> 01:13:25,420
Next is Michiyo-chan.

883
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:29,420
Michiyo is the most popular.

884
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:38,420
Thank you very much.

885
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:45,420
I will go to Fukujusou.

886
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:29,420
This is also an electric switch to go to Fukujusou.

887
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,420
This is also an electric switch to go to Fukujusou.

888
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:47,420
What is it? Did you come to see my meter?

889
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:49,420
There are so many.

890
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:50,420
Pusike?

891
01:14:50,420 --> 01:14:51,420
Pusike is a lighthouse.

892
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:54,420
It shines at a high place.

893
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:56,420
This is a black cake board.

894
01:14:59,420 --> 01:15:01,420
What is it? Did you come to see my meter?

895
01:15:01,420 --> 01:15:03,420
There are so many.

896
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:08,420
It's a meter otaku.

897
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:11,420
It's been a long time.

898
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:15,420
It shines on a white cake board.

899
01:15:19,420 --> 01:15:21,420
I can't stand this thin needle.

900
01:15:22,420 --> 01:15:28,420
This guy has a random number of cells.

901
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:33,420
Let's come to Gombe later.

902
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:37,420
I will go to Fukujusou.

903
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,420
I will go to Fukujusou.

904
01:15:47,420 --> 01:15:49,420
I will go to Fukujusou.

905
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:51,420
I will go to Fukujusou.

906
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,420
I will go to Fukujusou.

907
01:15:57,420 --> 01:15:59,420
I don't have it.

908
01:16:00,420 --> 01:16:04,420
It's hot.

909
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:07,420
I don't have it.

910
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:15,420
Six cells are rust, six cells are rust, six cells are rust.

911
01:16:15,420 --> 01:16:18,420
Six cells are correct.

912
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:21,420
I was reading something as a six-cell rust return.

913
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:49,420
The other day, I realized that my grandfather had been saying that I had a green fever and that I had a green fever, and I had been remembering it for a long time with a green fever, and when I grew up and started studying painting, I thought that a green fever was a normal cold, but if it wasn't for a green fever, it wouldn't have come properly.

914
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:53,420
That's what I remembered the other day.

915
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:59,420
My grandfather's name is Hajime, right?

916
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:03,420
His name is the grandfather I took from there.

917
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:09,420
I want to talk about my grandfather, but I don't know what to do.

918
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:16,420
He was a very strange grandfather.

919
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:26,420
He had been studying horse racing for about 25 years until he died.

920
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:34,420
Horse racing is a prediction, but I'm not trying to see it as a gamble.

921
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:47,420
He continued to take statistics on his notebook for 20 years based on the belief that horse racing is determined by four-dimensional laws.

922
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:59,420
There are a lot of notes in his pocket, and the research results are all displayed on a piece of paper, and he explains it to me, but even if I do it that way, I can't hit it.

923
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:09,420
I think he was really looking at the law of randomness.

924
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:12,420
He was a very strange grandfather.

925
01:18:13,420 --> 01:18:15,420
He was a very strange grandfather.

926
01:18:16,420 --> 01:18:18,420
He was a very strange grandfather.

927
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,420
He was a very strange grandfather.

928
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:24,420
He was a very strange grandfather.

929
01:18:25,420 --> 01:18:27,420
By the way, it's the first time I've seen him.

930
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:31,420
If you don't mind, please talk to me from time to time.

931
01:18:33,420 --> 01:18:35,420
He came to me right away.

932
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,420
He came to me right away.

933
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,420
I used to make things like that.

934
01:18:41,420 --> 01:18:46,420
As you can see now, I hope I can do it well from now on.

935
01:18:47,420 --> 01:18:48,420
I got the Adaptability station label.

936
01:18:50,420 --> 01:19:00,420
The Adaptability station label and the Shirogasu label are labels made for this complete version.

937
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:05,420
So this is not available on the display board.

938
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:14,420
There is a place where you can put it on randomly, but you can't get it unless you go there.

939
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,420
This is still fine.

940
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:27,420
There is no one who has to go in.

941
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:34,420
It's a time when Takashi-kun is not here now.

942
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,420
Let's wait a minute.

943
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:42,420
Takashi-kun only says what he wants to say.

944
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,420
The frog is a frog.

945
01:19:51,420 --> 01:19:53,420
I think it's pretty good.

946
01:19:53,420 --> 01:20:08,420
There are people who are not good at fishing, so it was the same with the original version.

947
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:13,420
If you care about it, you can clear it with just a bottle.

948
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:17,420
That's how it was made.

949
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:23,420
But this time, there was a guy who had to fish.

950
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:28,420
Jirobe, I don't know about fishing. I've never heard of it.

951
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:31,420
There was a small crab somewhere.

952
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,420
The crab ate smaller crabs than it ate every day.

953
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:40,420
But one day, suddenly, I couldn't eat anything.

954
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:42,420
Why?

955
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,420
I was eaten by a big crab.

956
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:49,420
The stamp of this story is important.

957
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,420
The stamp is the most important thing for me.

958
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:55,420
Did you understand?

959
01:21:00,420 --> 01:21:06,420
This time, it's the continuation of the crab.

960
01:21:07,420 --> 01:21:09,420
How many are there at the end?

961
01:21:10,420 --> 01:21:13,420
You just have to catch the water cannon and the spring water.

962
01:21:14,420 --> 01:21:20,420
Other than that, even if you want to catch it, you can clear it.

963
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:34,420
I have to catch it three times, so I have to catch it five or six times.

964
01:21:35,420 --> 01:21:40,420
If you catch crabs in the water cannon, there are a lot of expensive crabs.

965
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:43,420
The crab will be fine.

966
01:21:45,420 --> 01:21:49,420
If you catch the water cannon like this, everything will be fine.

967
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:51,420
Do you know?

968
01:21:52,420 --> 01:21:54,420
The taste changes depending on the place.

969
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:57,420
That's why the frog has a taste.

970
01:21:58,420 --> 01:22:01,420
Frogs all live in their favorite water.

971
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:04,420
This is the water I got from the juice.

972
01:22:05,420 --> 01:22:06,420
It's a valuable product.

973
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:10,420
No one can get in there right now.

974
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:12,420
Do you know the juice?

975
01:22:13,420 --> 01:22:14,420
I don't know.

976
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:18,420
The juice is a giant water purifier.

977
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:21,420
We don't fish.

978
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:23,420
We can drink the juice.

979
01:22:24,420 --> 01:22:25,420
The factory people do the same.

980
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:28,420
And the juice is a water purifier.

981
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:29,420
It's a water purifier.

982
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,420
It's a waste product of the water purifier machine.

983
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:35,420
It tastes like juice.

984
01:22:43,420 --> 01:22:44,420
It's a dangerous person.

985
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:53,420
With this.

986
01:22:58,420 --> 01:23:02,420
I wonder if everyone who can speak in one life has spoken.

987
01:23:13,420 --> 01:23:14,420
Well.

988
01:23:24,420 --> 01:23:25,420
I spoke.

989
01:23:26,420 --> 01:23:27,420
I spoke.

990
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:31,420
I spoke.

991
01:23:44,420 --> 01:23:45,420
Wait a minute.

992
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:48,420
I've been doing this for an hour.

993
01:23:55,420 --> 01:23:57,420
I want to catch a frog.

994
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:01,420
I'll go a little further.

995
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:24,420
I'm not going to wake up if I go.

996
01:24:25,420 --> 01:24:26,420
There are a lot of people.

997
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:31,420
I spoke well.

998
01:24:41,420 --> 01:24:42,420
D.

999
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:44,420
D.

1000
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:46,420
Don't come in here.

1001
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:48,420
I'm busy.

1002
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:52,420
It's you again.

1003
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:54,420
What do you want?

1004
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:56,420
Pushke.

1005
01:24:57,420 --> 01:24:58,420
Do you want to meet Pushke?

1006
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,420
You may know.

1007
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:04,420
It is made in the stomach of the white-tailed musk crab.

1008
01:25:06,420 --> 01:25:08,420
Crab and frog are fermented in the stomach.

1009
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,420
Since the reduction of water.

1010
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:12,420
Crab and frog are not enough.

1011
01:25:13,420 --> 01:25:14,420
Crab is difficult.

1012
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:17,420
Can you bring about 50 crabs?

1013
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:19,420
Crab can be caught in a bottle.

1014
01:25:20,420 --> 01:25:21,420
I don't care if I wake up.

1015
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:23,420
That's the story.

1016
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:26,420
D.

1017
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,420
Will you give it to me?

1018
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:31,420
OK.

1019
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:33,420
I gave it to the white-tailed musk crab.

1020
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:35,420
Listen.

1021
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:38,420
Pushke is in the lighthouse in the restricted area.

1022
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:42,420
But you have to go through the experiment factory to enter the lighthouse.

1023
01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:45,420
The experiment factory is next to the factory.

1024
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:47,420
It's the place I said earlier.

1025
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:53,420
You have to open the door with a special key to enter there.

1026
01:25:54,420 --> 01:25:55,420
It's impossible.

1027
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:57,420
Did you understand?

1028
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:00,420
I will punish you.

1029
01:26:01,420 --> 01:26:02,420
I will punish you.

1030
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:04,420
If you understand, please go.

1031
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:07,420
Chapter 2.

1032
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,420
D.

1033
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,420
It's very small.

1034
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:25,420
This is the smallest crab in my mind.

1035
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:28,420
This is the smallest crab in my mind.

1036
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:34,420
This is the biggest crab.

1037
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:37,420
D.

1038
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:39,420
How big is it?

1039
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:41,420
It's about this big.

1040
01:26:42,420 --> 01:26:44,420
It's about 10 cm bigger than the main character.

1041
01:26:44,420 --> 01:26:45,420
10 cm is about 10 cm.

1042
01:26:46,420 --> 01:26:49,420
It's a story about the standard.

1043
01:26:50,420 --> 01:26:55,420
And the couple is a single couple.

1044
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:01,420
Now the show has changed, so the whole line has changed.

1045
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:07,420
Well, it's changing again and again.

1046
01:27:08,420 --> 01:27:10,420
I want to put it on top.

1047
01:27:14,420 --> 01:27:15,420
I want to put it on top.

1048
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:21,420
Well, it's beautiful.

1049
01:27:45,420 --> 01:27:46,420
D.

1050
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:49,420
I have a favor to ask you, but it's not a big deal.

1051
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:54,420
I want you to deliver this crab miso to the most beautiful girl in Shirogase.

1052
01:27:55,420 --> 01:27:57,420
You will know immediately if you go to which girl.

1053
01:27:58,420 --> 01:27:59,420
Well, I was asked a little.

1054
01:28:00,420 --> 01:28:03,420
I can't open this place easily, so it's okay.

1055
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:05,420
Do you know the place in Shirogase?

1056
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:08,420
If you go around, you will find it.

1057
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:10,420
I got D.

1058
01:28:10,420 --> 01:28:11,420
I got D.

1059
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:23,420
Most people go to Shirogase No. 2, Lee and Lee's.

1060
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:30,420
If you go to the story in Shirogase No. 2, you can't do it immediately.

1061
01:28:31,420 --> 01:28:35,420
Everyone doesn't know the main store in Shirogase and doesn't use it at all.

1062
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:39,420
Also, you have an event, right?

1063
01:28:40,420 --> 01:28:42,420
There was not enough supply and demand in Shirogase.

1064
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:48,420
I want you to recognize the main store in Shirogase.

1065
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:53,420
It's a monkey of Smokey Monkeys.

1066
01:28:54,420 --> 01:28:59,420
I made this event because I had no choice but to make this event.

1067
01:28:59,420 --> 01:29:01,420
Shirogase No. 2

1068
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:10,420
There was an original monkey in Shirogase, except for Gimnon.

1069
01:29:11,420 --> 01:29:13,420
It was a little early.

1070
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:16,420
I want to meet you.

1071
01:29:17,420 --> 01:29:18,420
This is...

1072
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:22,420
Can I smoke a little?

1073
01:29:23,420 --> 01:29:24,420
Because it's Yannikasu.

1074
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,420
Yannikasu

1075
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:30,420
Excuse me.

1076
01:29:35,420 --> 01:29:37,420
Yannikasu

1077
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:42,420
From 7 o'clock to 0 o'clock.

1078
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:48,420
Yannikasu

1079
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:50,420
Yannikasu

1080
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:53,420
And...

1081
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:57,420
There's a monkey up there, so I'll take a break.

1082
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:03,420
I want to see my mom.

1083
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:09,420
Yannikasu

1084
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:16,420
Mom

1085
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:19,420
Mom

1086
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:24,420
She's not here.

1087
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:34,420
I don't have time.

1088
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:36,420
Mom

1089
01:30:37,420 --> 01:30:38,420
She's not here.

1090
01:30:42,420 --> 01:30:44,420
I made a mistake.

1091
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:45,420
Takashi

1092
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:50,420
When you cool your hot body like this, things get clearer.

1093
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:52,420
This is an important time.

1094
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:56,420
I don't even know what happened right after I did anything.

1095
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,420
It takes time to soak into your body.

1096
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,420
Say good things.

1097
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:08,420
See you next time.

1098
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:15,420
This is...

1099
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:20,420
Honda

1100
01:31:21,420 --> 01:31:24,420
I'd like you to remodel the car.

1101
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:33,420
Oh, I found it.

1102
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:35,420
It's getting better.

1103
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:36,420
It's getting better.

1104
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:44,420
The fuel consumption has increased by another 10%.

1105
01:31:46,420 --> 01:31:48,420
There are various factors to increase fuel consumption.

1106
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:53,420
Low fuel consumption, low rotation resistance, and increased driving efficiency.

1107
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:59,420
In addition, when it comes to low fuel consumption, the effect will be greatly different.

1108
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:03,420
But it doesn't mean you don't have to do it because the effect is low.

1109
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:04,420
That's what I'm aiming for.

1110
01:32:05,420 --> 01:32:10,420
If you find a mid-air shaft and a shield gear box, I hope you'll bring it.

1111
01:32:11,420 --> 01:32:12,420
Three types of cars

1112
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:16,420
The demand is escalating.

1113
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:21,420
How about an experimental factory?

1114
01:32:22,420 --> 01:32:25,420
After all, nothing has changed since I was the owner of the store.

1115
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:31,420
Pure agriculture is not supposed to make crab miso.

1116
01:32:32,420 --> 01:32:34,420
Don't you think so, brother?

1117
01:32:40,420 --> 01:32:41,420
Craftsman

1118
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:45,420
Yone

1119
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:48,420
The first one is an eraser.

1120
01:32:49,420 --> 01:32:51,420
This is a strange sound again.

1121
01:32:52,420 --> 01:32:54,420
Why do you erase it when you rub it?

1122
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:57,420
I wonder what you're going to use.

1123
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:00,420
Was there anything I had to erase?

1124
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:03,420
I wonder what kind of world it is.

1125
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:10,420
I think I've told you one thing.

1126
01:33:14,420 --> 01:33:17,420
I'm telling you something I don't know about M3.

1127
01:33:19,420 --> 01:33:22,420
The next one is a crane.

1128
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:25,420
What was the first one?

1129
01:33:28,420 --> 01:33:30,420
The second one is...

1130
01:33:32,420 --> 01:33:35,420
Let's go to the second one.

1131
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:42,420
Let's talk about the second one.

1132
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:51,420
If it's a factory, the people next to it might know about the factory, but they're all real.

1133
01:33:52,420 --> 01:33:55,420
Everyone forgets about their work except for their mother.

1134
01:33:56,420 --> 01:34:00,420
I know because I'm working right next to it, but I only say that.

1135
01:34:01,420 --> 01:34:06,420
If there's a reason, I might remember it, but if there's a reason, it's easy to remember.

1136
01:34:07,420 --> 01:34:12,420
If it's an old machine, there might be a machine that's familiar to you, but I wonder if there's anyone.

1137
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:15,420
Is it a machine of Fujiwara?

1138
01:34:16,420 --> 01:34:18,420
This is a great hint.

1139
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:26,420
Iya-san doesn't talk.

1140
01:34:26,420 --> 01:34:28,420
Tsuru-san.

1141
01:34:29,420 --> 01:34:32,420
What you're holding is a rust frog.

1142
01:34:33,420 --> 01:34:36,420
Tsuru-san's frog quest is...

1143
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:48,420
Every time you raise the body remodeling stage, the requirements are getting more and more difficult.

1144
01:34:48,420 --> 01:34:50,420
That's right.

1145
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:59,420
The body remodeling stage goes from stage 1 to stage 3, but if you raise it all of a sudden, you can't get it in the middle.

1146
01:35:00,420 --> 01:35:05,420
So if you raise the stage, it's a good thing to come.

1147
01:35:06,420 --> 01:35:08,420
Can you give it to me?

1148
01:35:09,420 --> 01:35:11,420
I gave you the rust frog.

1149
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:14,420
You're a nice kid. If you like, please do this.

1150
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:16,420
Bindou-shou.

1151
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:22,420
Bindou can only get crabs, so you can get hungry, but it's kind of lonely.

1152
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:28,420
There's a press machine, right? At the entrance to the restricted area.

1153
01:35:29,420 --> 01:35:30,420
That was made by Mia.

1154
01:35:31,420 --> 01:35:33,420
The New World and the lighthouse were all made by Mia.

1155
01:35:34,420 --> 01:35:35,420
I don't make anything now.

1156
01:35:36,420 --> 01:35:37,420
There's nothing to make.

1157
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:39,420
That person doesn't talk anymore.

1158
01:35:40,420 --> 01:35:42,420
If I say something to do, I just have to scratch my stomach.

1159
01:35:45,420 --> 01:35:49,420
In the old days, everyone thought that they could do something in this world.

1160
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:52,420
Not everyone was like that.

1161
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:56,420
Do you think you can do something in this world?

1162
01:36:02,420 --> 01:36:04,420
Do you really think so?

1163
01:36:05,420 --> 01:36:07,420
Well, if you think so, it may be happiness.

1164
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:10,420
Let's go to the side.

1165
01:36:10,420 --> 01:36:13,420
There's a lot of rust in the old Chibusa's line.

1166
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:16,420
It's like it's in the rust.

1167
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:26,420
No, that's right. I can't do anything.

1168
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:28,420
I'm lonely.

1169
01:36:36,420 --> 01:36:38,420
Let's go to the side.

1170
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:41,420
I can't do anything.

1171
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:44,420
I'm lonely.

1172
01:36:45,420 --> 01:36:47,420
I have to scratch my stomach.

1173
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:52,420
I can't do anything.

1174
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:55,420
I can't do anything.

1175
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:57,420
I'm lonely.

1176
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:00,420
I have to scratch my stomach.

1177
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:03,420
I can't do anything.

1178
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:09,420
I'm lonely.

1179
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:15,420
I'm going to clean it up.

1180
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:24,420
Welcome.

1181
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:30,420
Good-bye.

1182
01:37:30,420 --> 01:37:31,420
What?

1183
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:33,420
Will you give me this crab miso?

1184
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:35,420
Oh, Gimnon.

1185
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:37,420
He's really persistent, so it's okay.

1186
01:37:37,420 --> 01:37:39,420
Thank you.

1187
01:37:39,420 --> 01:37:41,420
I gave you Gimnon's crab miso.

1188
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:44,420
Gimnon Quest.

1189
01:37:52,420 --> 01:37:53,420
Gimnon.

1190
01:37:53,420 --> 01:37:55,420
I gave it to you.

1191
01:38:09,420 --> 01:38:11,420
Thank you.

1192
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:24,420
Did you give me the most beautiful crab miso?

1193
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:26,420
Thank you. You saved me.

1194
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:31,420
Crab miso is an expensive product, so I don't feel bad about it.

1195
01:38:32,420 --> 01:38:34,420
This is a thank you.

1196
01:38:34,420 --> 01:38:36,420
White Gosei 350.

1197
01:38:40,420 --> 01:38:42,420
It's been a long time.

1198
01:38:54,420 --> 01:38:57,420
Let's set up the red dango.

1199
01:38:58,420 --> 01:39:00,420
I'm going to take the red dango.

1200
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:05,420
This red dango and leaves...

1201
01:39:06,420 --> 01:39:10,420
There's a place for red dango and leaves.

1202
01:39:17,420 --> 01:39:19,420
Isn't it here now?

1203
01:39:21,420 --> 01:39:25,420
There's meat in front of the abyss.

1204
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:29,420
How much did I get here?

1205
01:39:29,420 --> 01:39:31,420
I couldn't get it.

1206
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:33,420
And here.

1207
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:35,420
Next to the abyss.

1208
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:39,420
That's all I can get.

1209
01:39:44,420 --> 01:39:46,420
It's a frog.

1210
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:52,420
It's not a rare frame, but there's a place I can get it.

1211
01:40:02,420 --> 01:40:07,420
That's what Yumu said earlier.

1212
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:10,420
This is it.

1213
01:40:10,420 --> 01:40:15,420
It's been a long time, but Tar-san seems to have a lot of fun with poison.

1214
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:18,420
Do you know poison?

1215
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:20,420
Poison was one body, but it was two.

1216
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:22,420
What are you doing now?

1217
01:40:22,420 --> 01:40:26,420
Why don't you talk to Tar-san about poison?

1218
01:40:27,420 --> 01:40:33,420
Now that the frog is standing, I can talk to Tar-san.

1219
01:40:33,420 --> 01:40:39,420
Now that the poison has changed, let's hear about the chain in the new world.

1220
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:43,420
With the reserve tank on.

1221
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:02,420
I thought I'd do it without listening to everything, but I forgot a lot.

1222
01:41:13,420 --> 01:41:16,420
I wonder if I'll mess with it.

1223
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:20,420
Modification.

1224
01:41:26,420 --> 01:41:28,420
Reserve tank on.

1225
01:41:30,420 --> 01:41:36,420
I don't usually use the reserve tank until it gets bigger.

1226
01:41:37,420 --> 01:41:43,420
The reason is that I like the timing of the supply.

1227
01:41:46,420 --> 01:41:48,420
It's so many.

1228
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:55,420
If I have too much spare time, I can't supply it, so it's boring.

1229
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:58,420
Rather, I want to supply it.

1230
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:17,420
Chen-san.

1231
01:42:18,420 --> 01:42:20,420
Chen-san.

1232
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:34,420
I can't stand it.

1233
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:37,420
They're pretending to understand.

1234
01:42:37,420 --> 01:42:41,420
Everyone is so scared, lonely, hungry.

1235
01:42:41,420 --> 01:42:44,420
That's all. It's boring.

1236
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:47,420
I'm not interested in that.

1237
01:42:47,420 --> 01:42:50,420
I want to use up what I'm interested in.

1238
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:52,420
I'll do anything for that.

1239
01:42:52,420 --> 01:42:54,420
There's nothing else to do.

1240
01:42:54,420 --> 01:42:56,420
It's boring.

1241
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:59,420
It's the worst to die of boredom.

1242
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:02,420
It's like this.

1243
01:43:02,420 --> 01:43:10,420
I thought Chen's sub-story was worse until I wrote it.

1244
01:43:10,420 --> 01:43:14,420
But it wasn't like that when I wrote it.

1245
01:43:17,420 --> 01:43:27,420
There are other people who are hated by everyone.

1246
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:49,420
It's boring.

1247
01:44:02,420 --> 01:44:05,420
I'll make money.

1248
01:44:17,420 --> 01:44:20,420
I'm going to buy a tank.

1249
01:44:25,420 --> 01:44:27,420
15 pieces.

1250
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:32,420
This is 1 piece.

1251
01:44:34,420 --> 01:44:37,420
There are 5 pieces in the reserve tank.

1252
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:49,420
Thank you very much.

1253
01:44:56,420 --> 01:44:57,420
D.

1254
01:44:57,420 --> 01:44:59,420
I told you everything I knew.

1255
01:44:59,420 --> 01:45:02,420
I don't know what you want to know, but why do you want to know so much?

1256
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:04,420
You're not normal.

1257
01:45:04,420 --> 01:45:06,420
Isn't that so?

1258
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:09,420
It's like you're not a machine in this world.

1259
01:45:12,420 --> 01:45:14,420
I hate it.

1260
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:20,420
What am I thinking?

1261
01:45:28,420 --> 01:45:30,420
Let's put it in there.

1262
01:45:30,420 --> 01:45:32,420
What is it?

1263
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:44,420
What is this?

1264
01:45:44,420 --> 01:45:46,420
I'll get a blue one.

1265
01:45:47,420 --> 01:45:49,420
Let's go home.

1266
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:16,420
I'll make some money.

1267
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:19,420
Hmm.

1268
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:30,420
Hmm.

1269
01:46:31,420 --> 01:46:33,420
Let's raise it.

1270
01:46:33,420 --> 01:46:34,420
Hmm.

1271
01:46:36,420 --> 01:46:38,420
Let's get some branches.

1272
01:46:39,420 --> 01:46:42,420
Let's get some branches.

1273
01:46:47,420 --> 01:46:48,420
Hmm.

1274
01:46:50,420 --> 01:46:52,420
Let's get some branches.

1275
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:55,420
I like white rice.

1276
01:46:55,420 --> 01:46:57,420
I want to catch white rice.

1277
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:02,420
Oh, white rice.

1278
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:03,420
Hmm.

1279
01:47:07,420 --> 01:47:08,420
Hmm.

1280
01:47:10,420 --> 01:47:11,420
Hmm.

1281
01:47:12,420 --> 01:47:13,420
Hmm.

1282
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:14,420
Hmm.

1283
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:20,420
I don't have many fishing rods.

1284
01:47:35,420 --> 01:47:36,420
Hmm.

1285
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:39,420
2, 5, 9 fishing rods.

1286
01:47:39,420 --> 01:47:40,420
Hmm.

1287
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:44,420
I'll make some money.

1288
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:49,420
Hmm.

1289
01:47:50,420 --> 01:47:51,420
Hmm.

1290
01:47:52,420 --> 01:47:55,420
Until I run out of fishing rods.

1291
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:14,420
Did it come?

1292
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:18,420
Hmm.

1293
01:48:25,420 --> 01:48:26,420
Did it come?

1294
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:30,420
It looks like it came.

1295
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:39,420
It came.

1296
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:46,420
This is the standard of making money in the beginning.

1297
01:48:48,420 --> 01:48:52,420
It's a little cheating even if you don't have fishing rods.

1298
01:48:52,420 --> 01:48:54,420
I'm sorry.

1299
01:48:58,420 --> 01:49:01,420
How much was it? Was it 300 yen?

1300
01:49:04,420 --> 01:49:06,420
This is...

1301
01:49:06,420 --> 01:49:08,420
I got a white rice.

1302
01:49:08,420 --> 01:49:10,420
I did it.

1303
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:13,420
3000 yen.

1304
01:49:17,420 --> 01:49:20,420
I can become stage 2 with this.

1305
01:49:20,420 --> 01:49:21,420
Hmm.

1306
01:49:21,420 --> 01:49:22,420
Hmm.

1307
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:24,420
Hmm.

1308
01:49:25,420 --> 01:49:26,420
Hmm.

1309
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:28,420
Hmm.

1310
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:30,420
Hmm.

1311
01:49:31,420 --> 01:49:32,420
Hmm.

1312
01:49:33,420 --> 01:49:34,420
Hmm.

1313
01:49:36,420 --> 01:49:37,420
Hmm.

1314
01:49:37,420 --> 01:49:38,420
Hmm.

1315
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:40,420
Hmm.

1316
01:49:40,420 --> 01:49:41,420
Hmm.

1317
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:44,420
Hmm.

1318
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:46,420
I don't have enough fishing rods.

1319
01:49:46,420 --> 01:50:06,420
There are a lot of settings, but the small settings are all up to Smokey Monkeys and Monkey Shiroho.

1320
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:17,420
But I think that gate-верm is easy to rely on when you play with lemon lawn.

1321
01:50:17,420 --> 01:50:19,420
I wonder if it's like that.

1322
01:50:23,420 --> 01:50:26,420
The original version is already in a row.

1323
01:50:28,420 --> 01:50:31,420
For example, one-twenty of rare gulls.

1324
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:34,420
Oh, my God.

1325
01:50:36,420 --> 01:50:41,420
It's a setting that allows rare gulls to be caught in a row.

1326
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:46,420
I think he's doing a little more.

1327
01:50:47,420 --> 01:51:10,420
It's not easy to catch a rare gull, so if you exchange it for the look that was in the hatchet earlier, you can get it.

1328
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:26,420
I want about ten.

1329
01:51:31,420 --> 01:51:33,420
If you talk, you can run away.

1330
01:51:33,420 --> 01:51:46,420
This body remodeling is now stage 1.

1331
01:51:47,420 --> 01:51:54,420
When the stage rises, the output increases, right?

1332
01:51:55,420 --> 01:52:00,420
Then the speed of pulling becomes faster.

1333
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:13,420
So, if you raise the body remodeling of the gulls that took time at first, it will be easier to catch.

1334
01:52:20,420 --> 01:52:23,420
How many did you catch? Eight.

1335
01:52:25,420 --> 01:52:27,420
I don't think there will be any more.

1336
01:52:30,420 --> 01:52:52,420
The frog fishing in the garage is not a battle, but a haksura.

1337
01:52:52,420 --> 01:53:01,420
Oh, I got it.

1338
01:53:02,420 --> 01:53:05,420
I've got a lot of 0-5.

1339
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:15,420
I got a 6-pin.

1340
01:53:16,420 --> 01:53:21,420
Let's raise the stage.

1341
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:28,420
It's good.

1342
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:38,420
How many stages did you catch?

1343
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:53,420
It was about 1,500 yen.

1344
01:53:57,420 --> 01:53:59,420
About 1,800 yen.

1345
01:54:02,420 --> 01:54:04,420
1,800 pieces.

1346
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:07,420
About 1,500 yen.

1347
01:54:28,420 --> 01:54:30,420
About 1,500 yen.

1348
01:54:34,420 --> 01:54:36,420
About 1,500 yen.

1349
01:54:48,420 --> 01:54:50,420
It's not coming.

1350
01:54:54,420 --> 01:54:56,420
There is a rust.

1351
01:54:57,420 --> 01:54:59,420
I got it.

1352
01:55:05,420 --> 01:55:07,420
About 1,500 yen.

1353
01:55:20,420 --> 01:55:23,420
It seems that it does not stick to the return.

1354
01:55:29,420 --> 01:55:31,420
I didn't get lost.

1355
01:55:35,420 --> 01:55:42,420
There was a situation where it didn't stick to the return.

1356
01:55:43,420 --> 01:55:49,420
It's aboutyt to talk to Mu.

1357
01:55:56,420 --> 01:56:04,420
You don't have to go to the integral store in such a place.

1358
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:06,420
It's not good to make a mess with your body.

1359
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:12,720
It's a different story to do fishing, but what's fun about making a strange medicine device?

1360
01:56:13,620 --> 01:56:17,720
You don't think of a new machine like Newm, but I don't know where it is.

1361
01:56:18,620 --> 01:56:19,920
Do you know Newm?

1362
01:56:22,720 --> 01:56:25,120
Newm is a machine that worked at Mia's place.

1363
01:56:25,420 --> 01:56:28,720
But Mia can't speak, so I wonder what she's doing now.

1364
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:33,420
From there, I went to the outside and went straight there.

1365
01:56:35,420 --> 01:56:51,720
If you go to Newm like this, you can get a hint that Chiyo-san is doing a strange thing.

1366
01:56:58,720 --> 01:56:59,720
My throat is getting better.

1367
01:57:04,420 --> 01:57:09,420
I don't know what Chiyo-san is doing, but I think it's a strange medicine device.

1368
01:57:24,420 --> 01:57:31,420
Then, let's go to the outside and go to the inside.

1369
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:39,420
It seems that Chiyo-san is doing a strange thing.

1370
01:57:39,420 --> 01:57:44,420
It seems that Chiyo-san is doing a strange thing.

1371
01:57:44,420 --> 01:57:49,420
It seems that Chiyo-san is doing a strange thing.

1372
01:57:50,420 --> 01:57:55,420
It seems that Chiyo-san is doing a strange thing.

1373
01:57:55,420 --> 01:58:00,420
It seems that Chiyo-san is doing a strange thing.

1374
01:58:08,420 --> 01:58:13,420
I don't think it's our job to do the experiment.

1375
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:18,420
We've been moving like a machine that's not us.

1376
01:58:19,420 --> 01:58:21,420
Everyone tells us to move.

1377
01:58:21,420 --> 01:58:25,420
But we can move if we are told to move, so we don't hate to move like that.

1378
01:58:26,420 --> 01:58:30,420
Because it's good to be able to move and generate.

1379
01:58:31,420 --> 01:58:35,420
It's hard because I can't generate without a machine that tells me to move.

1380
01:58:42,420 --> 01:58:46,420
It's dark. I can't remember anything. I'm being sucked in.

1381
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:52,420
Can you give me one of Junnu Station that you have?

1382
01:58:53,420 --> 01:58:55,420
Chiyo-san gave me Junnu Station.

1383
01:58:56,420 --> 01:58:59,420
Thank you. I can work tomorrow with this.

1384
01:59:00,420 --> 01:59:06,420
This is the event of Chiyo-san's recovery medicine.

1385
01:59:07,420 --> 01:59:12,420
This changes every day, but I forget.

1386
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:14,420
I forget.

1387
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:23,420
When I meet Tan-san, I will talk, so I will also listen to the stories of the people on the second floor.

1388
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:37,420
At this time ...

1389
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:42,420
There is a little time.

1390
01:59:44,420 --> 01:59:48,420
I'm going back to this red place.

1391
01:59:50,420 --> 01:59:54,420
9 to 1 is Yoshibue, and 1 to 3 is Konbei.

1392
01:59:57,420 --> 01:59:58,420
Maybe.

1393
01:59:58,420 --> 02:00:00,420
I'm sorry.

1394
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:12,420
After the experiment, we just sell the items that will be sent.

1395
02:00:13,420 --> 02:00:16,420
There seems to be a machine called Kopel-san, but I've never met him.

1396
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:22,420
I think I need some kind of song to get in there, but I don't know anything else.

1397
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:25,420
There was a very big crab somewhere.

1398
02:00:26,420 --> 02:00:33,420
When I'm with this guy, the crab eats smaller crabs than it does every day.

1399
02:00:34,420 --> 02:00:37,420
But one day I couldn't eat anything.

1400
02:00:38,420 --> 02:00:39,420
Why do you think?

1401
02:00:40,420 --> 02:00:41,420
I was eaten by a frog.

1402
02:00:42,420 --> 02:00:45,420
The lesson in this story is that stamps are important.

1403
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:46,420
That's what I'm talking about.

1404
02:00:49,420 --> 02:00:51,420
You're a narrow-minded old man.

1405
02:00:52,420 --> 02:00:54,420
I don't care about the experiment factory.

1406
02:00:55,420 --> 02:00:57,420
The only thing I like is what I made.

1407
02:00:58,420 --> 02:01:02,420
There are various things like a meter, a cake, a meter, a cake, a meter, a cake, etc.

1408
02:01:02,420 --> 02:01:03,420
It's not that bad.

1409
02:01:04,420 --> 02:01:06,420
I'm not good at it.

1410
02:01:07,420 --> 02:01:08,420
I wonder if I can make it in time.

1411
02:01:12,420 --> 02:01:16,420
I've heard that the experiment factory also has water and fertilizer.

1412
02:01:17,420 --> 02:01:20,420
They collect a lot of water and study it.

1413
02:01:21,420 --> 02:01:24,420
Water is the source of everything, so it's worth researching.

1414
02:01:25,420 --> 02:01:27,420
Well, if research is worth it.

1415
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:31,420
Do you think research is worth it?

1416
02:01:33,420 --> 02:01:34,420
I see.

1417
02:01:35,420 --> 02:01:37,420
Everything tastes good.

1418
02:01:38,420 --> 02:01:40,420
It tastes like Reiko.

1419
02:01:41,420 --> 02:01:43,420
This is a water collection.

1420
02:01:56,420 --> 02:01:57,420
Let's go to Fujisomu.

1421
02:02:02,420 --> 02:02:03,420
Let's go to Fujisomu.

1422
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:07,420
Send me a telegram.

1423
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:09,420
I need a memo.

1424
02:02:10,420 --> 02:02:11,420
It's hard to write.

1425
02:02:12,420 --> 02:02:13,420
It's a great machine.

1426
02:02:14,420 --> 02:02:15,420
It's rusty.

1427
02:02:16,420 --> 02:02:17,420
Let's exchange my telegram.

1428
02:02:20,420 --> 02:02:22,420
There was also a memo in the beginning.

1429
02:02:23,420 --> 02:02:26,420
It's a machine that makes the ultimate tuning.

1430
02:02:29,420 --> 02:02:31,420
Takashi always does the same thing.

1431
02:02:33,420 --> 02:02:37,420
It's a machine that makes the ultimate tuning.

1432
02:02:38,420 --> 02:02:42,420
It's a machine that makes the ultimate tuning.

1433
02:02:43,420 --> 02:02:44,420
It's not just that.

1434
02:02:45,420 --> 02:02:49,420
It's a machine that makes the ultimate tuning.

1435
02:02:50,420 --> 02:02:53,420
There are many other suspicious rumors.

1436
02:02:55,420 --> 02:03:00,420
There are many machines that say bad things about the experiment factory, but I don't hate it.

1437
02:03:00,420 --> 02:03:01,420
I don't like it.

1438
02:03:02,420 --> 02:03:03,420
I don't like it either.

1439
02:03:04,420 --> 02:03:05,420
But I think it's the same.

1440
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:10,420
Is it different to make a big circuit or to study something?

1441
02:03:11,420 --> 02:03:13,420
No, it may be different.

1442
02:03:15,420 --> 02:03:17,420
Is fishing and research different?

1443
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:20,420
But I don't know the difference.

1444
02:03:22,420 --> 02:03:23,420
It's difficult.

1445
02:03:24,420 --> 02:03:29,420
If fishing and research are really different, I would like to understand the difference.

1446
02:03:35,420 --> 02:03:36,420
Semiconductor.

1447
02:03:39,420 --> 02:03:40,420
It's a new type.

1448
02:03:40,420 --> 02:03:41,420
It's a new type.

1449
02:03:53,420 --> 02:03:55,420
I haven't talked about this yet.

1450
02:03:56,420 --> 02:03:57,420
Vulcanic acid.

1451
02:04:10,420 --> 02:04:11,420
It's a new type.

1452
02:04:11,420 --> 02:04:12,420
It's a new type.

1453
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:38,420
If I were me, I would move as it is.

1454
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:39,420
I have my own will.

1455
02:04:40,420 --> 02:04:41,420
An old demon.

1456
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:43,420
It wasn't there.

1457
02:04:46,420 --> 02:04:47,420
Vulcanic acid.

1458
02:04:50,420 --> 02:04:53,420
I don't like the experiment factory very much.

1459
02:04:54,420 --> 02:04:56,420
I used to go to the hardware store.

1460
02:04:57,420 --> 02:04:58,420
I made a lot of hardware.

1461
02:04:59,420 --> 02:05:01,420
But now there is no machine that wants hardware.

1462
02:05:02,420 --> 02:05:05,420
The hardware was used as a learning device.

1463
02:05:06,420 --> 02:05:09,420
But no one is interested in learning.

1464
02:05:11,420 --> 02:05:15,420
In this world, learning can only have very limited value.

1465
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:20,420
All the value is absorbed in the stomach of the machine.

1466
02:05:22,420 --> 02:05:25,420
Vulcanic acid is always desperate.

1467
02:05:25,420 --> 02:05:26,420
Vulcanic acid is always desperate.

1468
02:05:34,420 --> 02:05:37,420
I want to catch a white-billed spirit.

1469
02:05:40,420 --> 02:05:41,420
There is a needle.

1470
02:05:49,420 --> 02:05:54,420
I like white-billed spirits, so please let me catch them.

1471
02:05:55,420 --> 02:06:00,420
I want to catch white-billed spirits, so please let me catch them.

1472
02:06:15,420 --> 02:06:19,420
I don't think it's that difficult.

1473
02:06:25,420 --> 02:06:30,420
I want to catch white-billed spirits, so please let me catch them.

1474
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:36,420
The reason why Takashi appears in the fishing spot is...

1475
02:06:37,420 --> 02:06:40,420
He is always in the first chapter.

1476
02:06:41,420 --> 02:06:48,420
After the second chapter, he only stays in the fishing spot for half the time.

1477
02:06:49,420 --> 02:06:56,420
He always sticks to the fishing spot for the sake of the tutorial.

1478
02:06:56,420 --> 02:07:01,420
I want to catch white-billed spirits, so please let me catch them.

1479
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:18,420
I got a black-billed spirit.

1480
02:08:26,420 --> 02:08:34,420
The smoke is coming up here.

1481
02:08:44,420 --> 02:08:54,420
There is also a boiler in the Honda, but the smoke is coming out properly, but it is a boiler for power.

1482
02:08:57,420 --> 02:09:12,420
All Honda's machines are set to move the machine with a turbine made from one boiler.

1483
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:28,420
In the old days, there was only one big motor, but now there is a motor for each machine.

1484
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:48,420
In the old days, there was only one big motor, but now there is a motor for each machine.

1485
02:09:48,420 --> 02:09:58,420
This boiler is a boiler for cross-section machines.

1486
02:09:58,420 --> 02:10:04,420
This is the setting of the machine.

1487
02:10:06,420 --> 02:10:10,420
If you catch 20, you can catch one.

1488
02:10:11,420 --> 02:10:17,420
If you catch 20, you can catch one.

1489
02:10:28,420 --> 02:10:33,420
If you catch 20, you can catch one.

1490
02:10:34,420 --> 02:10:38,420
There is not enough time.

1491
02:10:38,420 --> 02:11:04,420
I thought it would take a long time if I did it for 3 hours, but maybe it won't end if I do it 6 times.

1492
02:11:09,420 --> 02:11:11,420
It's okay.

1493
02:11:15,420 --> 02:11:17,420
No, it's not here.

1494
02:11:39,420 --> 02:11:41,420
It's not here.

1495
02:11:42,420 --> 02:11:44,420
I'll tell you later.

1496
02:11:44,420 --> 02:11:46,420
I'll tell you later.

1497
02:11:47,420 --> 02:11:49,420
I'll tell you later.

1498
02:11:50,420 --> 02:11:52,420
I'll tell you later.

1499
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:55,420
There was a simple song attached to each machine.

1500
02:11:56,420 --> 02:11:59,420
When I made a sound, I thought it was very lively.

1501
02:12:00,420 --> 02:12:01,420
The sound has a strange power.

1502
02:12:02,420 --> 02:12:07,420
When I noticed that I was making a song with a song, I was shown the device that made the sound itself.

1503
02:12:08,420 --> 02:12:09,420
Then I made an organ.

1504
02:12:10,420 --> 02:12:13,420
I thought about it when I saw the organ I made.

1505
02:12:14,420 --> 02:12:15,420
That's right.

1506
02:12:16,420 --> 02:12:18,420
You should also make an instrument.

1507
02:12:19,420 --> 02:12:21,420
You should think that you are making an organ.

1508
02:12:22,420 --> 02:12:25,420
There is only one piece of paper left on the score sheet.

1509
02:12:26,420 --> 02:12:27,420
Nothing difficult.

1510
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:31,420
The only thing you need to do is to make a hole in the paper.

1511
02:12:33,420 --> 02:12:34,420
I'll make a hole with this punch.

1512
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:36,420
Let's try it.

1513
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:39,420
The first sound is this.

1514
02:12:40,420 --> 02:12:41,420
Next is here.

1515
02:12:41,420 --> 02:12:44,420
Yes, that's fine. It's in a good condition.

1516
02:12:44,420 --> 02:12:48,420
Great. It's done. Let's play it right away.

1517
02:13:02,420 --> 02:13:04,420
It's a good song. It's very good.

1518
02:13:04,420 --> 02:13:06,420
I got my own song.

1519
02:13:06,420 --> 02:13:09,420
Remember this melody, everyone.

1520
02:13:10,420 --> 02:13:13,420
It's going to be important later.

1521
02:13:16,420 --> 02:13:19,420
Let's listen to Mulcanilo.

1522
02:13:30,420 --> 02:13:34,420
Mulcanilo's music, which is often said to be a recital.

1523
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:42,420
Mulcanilo's music, which is often said to be a recital.

1524
02:13:48,420 --> 02:13:50,420
That was my recital.

1525
02:13:50,420 --> 02:13:53,420
Thank you, everyone.

1526
02:14:03,420 --> 02:14:06,420
What did I do? Oh, I see.

1527
02:14:07,420 --> 02:14:10,420
I wanted to make it stage 2.

1528
02:14:20,420 --> 02:14:22,420
Uncle.

1529
02:14:26,420 --> 02:14:28,420
3400 yen.

1530
02:14:28,420 --> 02:14:30,420
7000 yen.

1531
02:14:30,420 --> 02:14:33,420
I got 24 branches.

1532
02:14:38,420 --> 02:14:40,420
This is good.

1533
02:14:42,420 --> 02:14:45,420
Then, let's release it.

1534
02:14:58,420 --> 02:15:01,420
Let's listen to Mulcanilo's music.

1535
02:15:11,420 --> 02:15:14,420
Let's listen to Mulcanilo's music.

1536
02:15:14,420 --> 02:15:16,420
It's a great view.

1537
02:15:16,420 --> 02:15:18,420
Explain.

1538
02:15:18,420 --> 02:15:21,420
By removing the view, it becomes visible from the output.

1539
02:15:21,420 --> 02:15:24,420
It is necessary when remodeling with a wheel.

1540
02:15:24,420 --> 02:15:27,420
It's a carburetor.

1541
02:15:27,420 --> 02:15:30,420
I haven't had this recently.

1542
02:15:30,420 --> 02:15:33,420
It's a QL injection.

1543
02:15:34,420 --> 02:15:36,420
5 tubes.

1544
02:15:36,420 --> 02:15:38,420
5 tubes.

1545
02:15:38,420 --> 02:15:40,420
5 tubes.

1546
02:15:40,420 --> 02:15:42,420
5 tubes.

1547
02:15:43,420 --> 02:15:45,420
5 tubes.

1548
02:15:45,420 --> 02:15:48,420
By increasing the exhaust efficiency, it can improve the output.

1549
02:15:48,420 --> 02:15:51,420
It is necessary when remodeling with a wheel.

1550
02:15:53,420 --> 02:15:56,420
This is the main engine.

1551
02:15:56,420 --> 02:15:59,420
It's a short-term setting.

1552
02:16:01,420 --> 02:16:03,420
2 bulbs.

1553
02:16:03,420 --> 02:16:05,420
It's not a 2 bulb.

1554
02:16:05,420 --> 02:16:08,420
There are two places to go.

1555
02:16:08,420 --> 02:16:10,420
There are two places to go.

1556
02:16:10,420 --> 02:16:13,420
It's a setting, and the 5 tubes are effective.

1557
02:16:17,420 --> 02:16:19,420
It's about the engine.

1558
02:16:19,420 --> 02:16:21,420
The body.

1559
02:16:27,420 --> 02:16:30,420
It's like a bike engine.

1560
02:16:32,420 --> 02:16:34,420
One piston.

1561
02:16:34,420 --> 02:16:36,420
It's called a short-term setting.

1562
02:16:37,420 --> 02:16:39,420
It's a carburetor.

1563
02:16:39,420 --> 02:16:43,420
When remodeling, the graphics here and here will change.

1564
02:16:45,420 --> 02:16:47,420
Let's go play.

1565
02:17:06,420 --> 02:17:08,420
It's a carburetor.

1566
02:17:12,420 --> 02:17:14,420
It's a carburetor.

1567
02:17:17,420 --> 02:17:19,420
It's about the engine.

1568
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:29,420
The body has been remodeled to STAGE 2.

1569
02:17:29,420 --> 02:17:31,420
The output has improved.

1570
02:17:31,420 --> 02:17:33,420
The power consumption has improved by 20%.

1571
02:17:34,420 --> 02:17:36,420
OK.

1572
02:17:37,420 --> 02:17:41,420
A large frog has appeared.

1573
02:17:45,420 --> 02:17:49,420
I remodeled it, so let's go to Tsuru-san.

1574
02:17:55,420 --> 02:17:59,420
STAGE 2 is Muramashi.

1575
02:18:03,420 --> 02:18:05,420
Tsuru-san.

1576
02:18:18,420 --> 02:18:20,420
Tsuru-san.

1577
02:18:33,420 --> 02:18:35,420
Tsuru-san.

1578
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:39,420
Oh.

1579
02:18:39,420 --> 02:18:41,420
Isn't what you have a frog?

1580
02:18:41,420 --> 02:18:43,420
Would you like to sell me one?

1581
02:18:43,420 --> 02:18:45,420
It's a good thing.

1582
02:18:45,420 --> 02:18:47,420
You are a really kind child.

1583
02:18:47,420 --> 02:18:49,420
If you like, please take this.

1584
02:18:49,420 --> 02:18:53,420
It's a little shabby.

1585
02:18:53,420 --> 02:18:55,420
It's been a long time since I've been a frog.

1586
02:18:55,420 --> 02:18:57,420
It would be nice if you could come in.

1587
02:18:57,420 --> 02:19:00,420
That child seems to be busy.

1588
02:19:03,420 --> 02:19:05,420
OK.

1589
02:19:05,420 --> 02:19:07,420
I wonder if it's okay to move on.

1590
02:19:12,420 --> 02:19:14,420
Let's go to Tsuru-san.

1591
02:19:20,420 --> 02:19:22,420
There are still two chapters left.

1592
02:19:25,420 --> 02:19:27,420
Oh, this has changed.

1593
02:19:29,420 --> 02:19:31,420
It has been remodeled.

1594
02:19:33,420 --> 02:19:35,420
OK.

1595
02:19:47,420 --> 02:19:48,420
OK.

1596
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:50,420
Tsuru-san.

1597
02:19:50,420 --> 02:19:52,420
OK.

1598
02:20:00,420 --> 02:20:02,420
The time is just right.

1599
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:11,420
Taa-san.

1600
02:20:11,420 --> 02:20:13,420
There are two poisons. I know.

1601
02:20:13,420 --> 02:20:15,420
Poison and me.

1602
02:20:15,420 --> 02:20:17,420
Three friends.

1603
02:20:18,420 --> 02:20:19,420
Poison and me.

1604
02:20:19,420 --> 02:20:20,420
I remember.

1605
02:20:20,420 --> 02:20:21,420
The song of the sheep.

1606
02:20:21,420 --> 02:20:22,420
Poison.

1607
02:20:22,420 --> 02:20:23,420
Music.

1608
02:20:23,420 --> 02:20:24,420
All or.

1609
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:25,420
Poison.

1610
02:20:25,420 --> 02:20:26,420
Copper.

1611
02:20:26,420 --> 02:20:27,420
Poison.

1612
02:20:27,420 --> 02:20:29,420
Open the key.

1613
02:20:30,420 --> 02:20:32,420
Poison.

1614
02:20:32,420 --> 02:20:34,420
Chapter 3.

1615
02:20:38,420 --> 02:20:39,420
Poison.

1616
02:20:39,420 --> 02:20:41,420
I like the song.

1617
02:20:41,420 --> 02:20:42,420
Poison.

1618
02:20:42,420 --> 02:20:43,420
I am the poison.

1619
02:20:43,420 --> 02:20:44,420
Poison.

1620
02:20:44,420 --> 02:20:45,420
Poison.

1621
02:20:45,420 --> 02:20:46,420
Poison.

1622
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:47,420
Food.

1623
02:20:55,420 --> 02:20:57,420
This is our song.

1624
02:20:57,420 --> 02:20:58,420
Poison.

1625
02:20:59,420 --> 02:21:00,420
Poison.

1626
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:03,420
Oh, I've already changed the posters.

1627
02:21:04,420 --> 02:21:06,420
I've changed it.

1628
02:21:07,420 --> 02:21:09,420
He is the child who has a head of two.

1629
02:21:11,420 --> 02:21:14,420
On the poster just now, I'm telling you to use the lighting machine.

1630
02:21:14,420 --> 02:21:19,920
I think there was a poster, but you can see it later, but that's the poison, isn't it?

1631
02:21:22,920 --> 02:21:27,420
Then, with this ... Oh, that's it.

1632
02:21:35,420 --> 02:21:43,420
When surrounded by posters, you feel like your body is spread out like this and the screws fly out.

1633
02:21:45,420 --> 02:21:49,420
If you don't like it, it's okay.

1634
02:21:53,420 --> 02:21:55,420
Well ...

1635
02:21:56,420 --> 02:22:04,420
If you change your gut, your self will change.

1636
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:10,420
Hah-san, it's good to sing, isn't it?

1637
02:22:11,420 --> 02:22:15,420
Would you like to share one of the high-grade fertilizers you have?

1638
02:22:16,420 --> 02:22:21,420
I put out the high-grade fertilizers. Thank you. I can work tomorrow with this.

1639
02:22:21,420 --> 02:22:37,420
Hah-san has a request that is more disgusting than changing the amount of money you give.

1640
02:22:38,420 --> 02:22:44,420
Hah-san, it's a pity, but we don't have a school. Why don't you ask your father?

1641
02:22:45,420 --> 02:22:51,420
It seems that Asuka has already quit, but I think your father is still somewhere. I think it was before Hantera.

1642
02:22:56,420 --> 02:23:00,420
It's already right. Let's go quickly.

1643
02:23:01,420 --> 02:23:05,420
Oh, but that's it. Well, is it okay?

1644
02:23:07,420 --> 02:23:13,420
Hah-san, it's a pity, but we don't have a school. Why don't you ask your father?

1645
02:23:27,420 --> 02:23:31,420
I know what you want to say. I want to say that I don't know where you are looking.

1646
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:35,420
Let's exchange the rust-returning spores for my spores.

1647
02:23:44,420 --> 02:23:48,420
Hah-san, this is the original owner of Kappan Castle.

1648
02:23:49,420 --> 02:23:53,420
Certainly, I have made a school. It's a long time ago.

1649
02:23:54,420 --> 02:23:58,420
Do you know what a new world is? I've already said that.

1650
02:23:59,420 --> 02:24:03,420
Until then, it was my job to make books and diaries.

1651
02:24:04,420 --> 02:24:10,420
But after that, the core of my job was to make posters and flyers of the new world.

1652
02:24:11,420 --> 02:24:15,420
And just at that time, the roots of this world began to decrease.

1653
02:24:16,420 --> 02:24:18,420
Probably because of the rapid decrease in water.

1654
02:24:19,420 --> 02:24:22,420
You can't make it with roots that grow from paper and water.

1655
02:24:23,420 --> 02:24:26,420
If the roots decrease, you can't make paper.

1656
02:24:26,420 --> 02:24:31,420
I had no choice but to make posters using diaries and school books.

1657
02:24:32,420 --> 02:24:39,420
I don't know if there is a school you are looking for in the posters you made at that time, but there is a possibility.

1658
02:24:40,420 --> 02:24:47,420
I forgot someone, but I've heard that there is a person who collects my posters.

1659
02:24:48,420 --> 02:24:50,420
Why don't you ask that person?

1660
02:24:51,420 --> 02:24:55,420
Certainly, I think it was a person whose eyes were always shaking.

1661
02:24:58,420 --> 02:24:59,420
Like this.

1662
02:25:02,420 --> 02:25:08,420
If you meet such a person, you will lose your life.

1663
02:25:09,420 --> 02:25:11,420
Shall we go for an inspection?

1664
02:25:14,420 --> 02:25:17,420
I want to go here too. Ah, the time is bad.

1665
02:25:18,420 --> 02:25:19,420
What should I do?

1666
02:25:20,420 --> 02:25:21,420
Let's wait.

1667
02:25:26,420 --> 02:25:27,420
It's quite different.

1668
02:25:28,420 --> 02:25:29,420
Let's wait.

1669
02:25:30,420 --> 02:25:31,420
The waiting place.

1670
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:38,420
Here.

1671
02:25:39,420 --> 02:25:41,420
There is a label.

1672
02:25:42,420 --> 02:25:43,420
I understand.

1673
02:25:45,420 --> 02:25:47,420
It says BULCANIO TOY WORKS.

1674
02:25:47,420 --> 02:25:48,420
It says BULCANIO TOY WORKS.

1675
02:25:50,420 --> 02:25:56,420
It also says BULCANIO TOY WORKS on the top right.

1676
02:25:56,420 --> 02:25:58,420
It says BULCANIO TOY WORKS on the top right.

1677
02:26:09,420 --> 02:26:10,420
Hello.

1678
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:14,420
Is school books about the paper cut that makes sound from that stupid school book?

1679
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:17,420
Do you have an interest in such things as I do?

1680
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:19,420
It's not a prop.

1681
02:26:20,420 --> 02:26:21,420
There was a frog somewhere.

1682
02:26:22,420 --> 02:26:24,420
The frog ate a lot of crabs every day.

1683
02:26:24,420 --> 02:26:27,420
But one day, it suddenly couldn't eat anything.

1684
02:26:28,420 --> 02:26:29,420
Why?

1685
02:26:30,420 --> 02:26:31,420
It ate everything.

1686
02:26:32,420 --> 02:26:34,420
The lesson in this story is that stamps are important.

1687
02:26:36,420 --> 02:26:38,420
You should take care of stamps too.

1688
02:26:41,420 --> 02:26:42,420
Mr. Stamp Teacher.

1689
02:26:44,420 --> 02:26:46,420
Isn't it a school book?

1690
02:26:48,420 --> 02:26:49,420
Let's go there.

1691
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:57,420
Why did I see such a thing?

1692
02:26:58,420 --> 02:27:00,420
Something has changed since then.

1693
02:27:01,420 --> 02:27:03,420
After all, there is nothing here that is certain.

1694
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:07,420
This is...

1695
02:27:09,420 --> 02:27:10,420
Such a thing is...

1696
02:27:11,420 --> 02:27:13,420
It will be clear later.

1697
02:27:16,420 --> 02:27:18,420
It's a story of the Pusikei riot.

1698
02:27:18,420 --> 02:27:20,420
It's a story of the Pusikei riot.

1699
02:27:23,420 --> 02:27:26,420
In the story of the Pusikei riot a while ago,

1700
02:27:27,420 --> 02:27:32,420
it seems that the three people in the factory didn't know anything or saw something scary.

1701
02:27:33,420 --> 02:27:35,420
It's all the same story.

1702
02:27:36,420 --> 02:27:42,420
This is a story that has been told as an important incident in this story.

1703
02:27:49,420 --> 02:27:50,420
All right.

1704
02:27:51,420 --> 02:27:52,420
Let's take a break.

1705
02:27:57,420 --> 02:28:00,420
If you put it in the register, the show will continue.

1706
02:28:03,420 --> 02:28:05,420
I have to listen to the story of the Pusikei riot.

1707
02:28:05,420 --> 02:28:07,420
I have to listen to the story of the Pusikei riot.

1708
02:28:17,420 --> 02:28:19,420
I went around a while ago, so...

1709
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:22,420
Three.

1710
02:28:28,420 --> 02:28:30,420
Please listen to the story of the Pusikei riot.

1711
02:28:35,420 --> 02:28:37,420
Let's listen to the story of the Pusikei riot.

1712
02:28:43,420 --> 02:28:45,420
Let's listen to the story of the Pusikei riot.

1713
02:28:47,420 --> 02:28:48,420
This is a hint.

1714
02:28:49,420 --> 02:28:50,420
There was a building called the Kappanjo.

1715
02:28:51,420 --> 02:28:52,420
They were selling various things there.

1716
02:28:53,420 --> 02:28:54,420
They were making music books.

1717
02:28:55,420 --> 02:28:58,420
They were also making labels, stamps, diaries, and even Kappankaki.

1718
02:28:59,420 --> 02:29:00,420
There is a building called the Fukujutsuho.

1719
02:29:01,420 --> 02:29:02,420
That was originally the Kappanjo.

1720
02:29:02,420 --> 02:29:04,420
What is the owner of the Kappanjo doing?

1721
02:29:07,420 --> 02:29:08,420
I don't know much about singing.

1722
02:29:09,420 --> 02:29:11,420
But I'm not going to ask people.

1723
02:29:13,420 --> 02:29:14,420
I'm always looking from here.

1724
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:16,420
I can't see much.

1725
02:29:19,420 --> 02:29:25,420
But it's fun to see you growl and see the steam coming out of the real boiler.

1726
02:29:27,420 --> 02:29:30,420
I don't want to see anything special.

1727
02:29:30,420 --> 02:29:32,420
Isn't it enough with a small change?

1728
02:29:33,420 --> 02:29:35,420
That's what it means to have me here.

1729
02:29:54,420 --> 02:29:59,420
This boiler looks like this.

1730
02:30:01,420 --> 02:30:02,420
This is it.

1731
02:30:05,420 --> 02:30:06,420
The place on the left.

1732
02:30:09,420 --> 02:30:12,420
If you go this way, a scary thing is waiting for you.

1733
02:30:16,420 --> 02:30:19,420
If it was the original version, it wouldn't have been stopped here, so it's an immediate death.

1734
02:30:27,420 --> 02:30:29,420
Let's listen to the story of the people here.

1735
02:30:31,420 --> 02:30:32,420
This is it.

1736
02:30:35,420 --> 02:30:38,420
The person who came up with the Orgole was a good guy named Burcarino.

1737
02:30:39,420 --> 02:30:43,420
Unlike Lao and Ain, they just used what Burcarino made.

1738
02:30:44,420 --> 02:30:46,420
It all started with the best angle.

1739
02:30:47,420 --> 02:30:53,420
Even if it was Burcarino, I don't think that little Orgole would have created such a scary power.

1740
02:30:54,420 --> 02:30:56,420
I don't think the most people know anything.

1741
02:30:57,420 --> 02:31:02,420
The balance of the running device is important.

1742
02:31:03,420 --> 02:31:05,420
Even if the frame is too strong, it doesn't work.

1743
02:31:06,420 --> 02:31:08,420
Even if the car is too stiff, it will be tired.

1744
02:31:17,420 --> 02:31:21,420
The two have a strange power, so they laugh a lot.

1745
02:31:22,420 --> 02:31:28,420
I think there is a special meaning to this sound.

1746
02:31:30,420 --> 02:31:32,420
My favorite sound is the sound of this factory.

1747
02:31:33,420 --> 02:31:35,420
This is my place.

1748
02:31:36,420 --> 02:31:38,420
What is your favorite sound?

1749
02:31:39,420 --> 02:31:41,420
You don't have to answer. I just asked.

1750
02:31:48,420 --> 02:31:50,420
The factory sound is noisy.

1751
02:31:52,420 --> 02:31:54,420
The factory sound is noisy.

1752
02:31:57,420 --> 02:32:03,420
When I was a child, my house was a press machine factory.

1753
02:32:04,420 --> 02:32:06,420
It was very noisy.

1754
02:32:07,420 --> 02:32:09,420
It was noisy.

1755
02:32:10,420 --> 02:32:12,420
It was called a kick-off.

1756
02:32:13,420 --> 02:32:15,420
There was a toy for the machine.

1757
02:32:16,420 --> 02:32:26,420
I pressed the iron plate with an empty mold and shaped it.

1758
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:32,420
There are many factory machines that are like that.

1759
02:32:32,420 --> 02:32:51,420
When I stepped on the pedal with my feet, the heavy parts of the press machine came down from above.

1760
02:32:52,420 --> 02:32:54,420
It's been like that all day.

1761
02:32:55,420 --> 02:32:57,420
It's dangerous.

1762
02:32:58,420 --> 02:33:02,420
When people get tired, they get tired of their fingers.

1763
02:33:03,420 --> 02:33:07,420
There are a lot of people who don't have a lot of fingers.

1764
02:33:12,420 --> 02:33:13,420
It's annoying.

1765
02:33:14,420 --> 02:33:16,420
If you have a reason, you will be lonely.

1766
02:33:17,420 --> 02:33:19,420
I don't want to be lonely every day.

1767
02:33:24,420 --> 02:33:27,420
Let's go listen to the sound of the iron plate.

1768
02:33:30,420 --> 02:33:37,420
Recently, all the noisy factories have been gone.

1769
02:33:39,420 --> 02:33:41,420
The factory itself.

1770
02:33:46,420 --> 02:33:48,420
Let's listen to the sound of the iron plate.

1771
02:33:55,420 --> 02:33:57,420
I'll try to meet my mother.

1772
02:34:17,420 --> 02:34:18,420
I found it.

1773
02:34:19,420 --> 02:34:20,420
It's my fuki.

1774
02:34:21,420 --> 02:34:22,420
Do you know fuki?

1775
02:34:22,420 --> 02:34:23,420
Fuhi.

1776
02:34:23,420 --> 02:34:24,420
I went somewhere.

1777
02:34:25,420 --> 02:34:27,420
Fuhi at the tip of the stick.

1778
02:34:27,420 --> 02:34:28,420
Round head.

1779
02:34:28,420 --> 02:34:29,420
Fuhi.

1780
02:34:29,420 --> 02:34:30,420
Cute face.

1781
02:34:32,420 --> 02:34:33,420
I was able to hear it.

1782
02:34:34,420 --> 02:34:35,420
I'm so lucky.

1783
02:34:36,420 --> 02:34:38,420
This is another one of N3.

1784
02:34:38,420 --> 02:34:40,420
I don't know what it is.

1785
02:34:40,420 --> 02:34:41,420
I like frogs.

1786
02:34:41,420 --> 02:34:43,420
Sometimes, I go fishing.

1787
02:34:44,420 --> 02:34:46,420
Hey, are you remodeling your body?

1788
02:34:47,420 --> 02:34:49,420
If you want to catch big fish, you should definitely run.

1789
02:34:50,420 --> 02:34:52,420
If it's a rusty frog, it will be useless.

1790
02:34:53,420 --> 02:34:55,420
At least do stage 2.

1791
02:34:56,420 --> 02:34:57,420
I like stage 3.

1792
02:34:58,420 --> 02:35:01,420
But I'm not good at fishing, so I can't catch it well.

1793
02:35:02,420 --> 02:35:03,420
I'm sorry.

1794
02:35:04,420 --> 02:35:05,420
I'm sorry.

1795
02:35:06,420 --> 02:35:07,420
I'm sorry.

1796
02:35:07,420 --> 02:35:10,420
But I'm not good at fishing, so I can't catch it well.

1797
02:35:13,420 --> 02:35:18,420
If it's stage 2, I'll get the parts I'm looking for, but it's hard to collect the parts for stage 3.

1798
02:35:21,420 --> 02:35:24,420
This is the foreshadow of the next quest.

1799
02:35:37,420 --> 02:35:39,420
Let's repair this.

1800
02:35:40,420 --> 02:35:42,420
I have a lot of money, so I'll give it to you.

1801
02:36:07,420 --> 02:36:09,420
I'm going to talk to this guy.

1802
02:36:10,420 --> 02:36:11,420
D3.

1803
02:36:13,420 --> 02:36:15,420
You're looking for something.

1804
02:36:15,420 --> 02:36:17,420
It's probably something that's not here.

1805
02:36:17,420 --> 02:36:18,420
That's right.

1806
02:36:19,420 --> 02:36:20,420
I'm different.

1807
02:36:20,420 --> 02:36:22,420
What I want is nothing.

1808
02:36:22,420 --> 02:36:24,420
That's what most people do.

1809
02:36:24,420 --> 02:36:26,420
It's possible here.

1810
02:36:28,420 --> 02:36:30,420
You're making me angry.

1811
02:36:31,420 --> 02:36:32,420
That's right.

1812
02:36:33,420 --> 02:36:35,420
You're making me angry.

1813
02:36:36,420 --> 02:36:39,420
I can't get out of my head.

1814
02:36:40,420 --> 02:36:44,420
That's because I made a volcano and an orgole.

1815
02:36:45,420 --> 02:36:47,420
The volcano guy is thinking about something stupid.

1816
02:36:48,420 --> 02:36:50,420
He's doing nothing because of him.

1817
02:36:51,420 --> 02:36:53,420
What does he think of me?

1818
02:36:54,420 --> 02:36:56,420
He doesn't like anything.

1819
02:36:57,420 --> 02:36:58,420
He's a really stingy guy.

1820
02:36:59,420 --> 02:37:00,420
I hate you.

1821
02:37:05,420 --> 02:37:08,420
D3 is a man with a narrow mind.

1822
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:11,420
I can't help it.

1823
02:37:28,420 --> 02:37:29,420
Sen.

1824
02:38:05,420 --> 02:38:06,420
Sen.

1825
02:38:20,420 --> 02:38:21,420
I'm here.

1826
02:38:27,420 --> 02:38:29,420
D3 is a stingy guy.

1827
02:38:29,420 --> 02:38:31,420
Let's talk about D3.

1828
02:38:31,420 --> 02:38:33,420
D3 is a stingy guy.

1829
02:38:33,420 --> 02:38:35,420
He's a stingy guy.

1830
02:38:36,420 --> 02:38:38,420
He's a really stingy guy.

1831
02:38:40,420 --> 02:38:42,420
He's a stingy guy.

1832
02:38:42,420 --> 02:38:44,420
He's not doing anything.

1833
02:38:44,420 --> 02:38:46,420
He's moving behind me.

1834
02:38:46,420 --> 02:38:48,420
What's bothering you?

1835
02:38:48,420 --> 02:38:49,420
What's the problem?

1836
02:38:49,420 --> 02:38:50,420
It's ridiculous.

1837
02:38:50,420 --> 02:38:52,420
He's just looking at me.

1838
02:38:52,420 --> 02:38:55,420
He's just laughing while looking at me.

1839
02:38:57,420 --> 02:38:59,420
I'm the one who erased the shadow of Rizu.

1840
02:39:00,420 --> 02:39:02,420
But it's reasonable to want it.

1841
02:39:02,420 --> 02:39:05,420
He couldn't stand the fact that Rizu is gone.

1842
02:39:07,420 --> 02:39:09,420
He has no choice but to laugh.

1843
02:39:09,420 --> 02:39:10,420
He has no choice but to laugh.

1844
02:39:10,420 --> 02:39:11,420
He has no choice but to laugh.

1845
02:39:11,420 --> 02:39:13,420
Well, I had a lot of fun.

1846
02:39:17,420 --> 02:39:19,420
Was there a poster of Shadow of Rizu?

1847
02:39:20,420 --> 02:39:21,420
Let's see.

1848
02:39:26,420 --> 02:39:28,420
This is...

1849
02:39:32,420 --> 02:39:37,420
This is the Rizu that Chaine was talking about.

1850
02:39:37,420 --> 02:39:43,420
There's a dress machine at Shirogaseya No. 2 store.

1851
02:39:43,420 --> 02:39:51,420
This is a record of Chen erasing the shadow of that dress machine.

1852
02:39:51,420 --> 02:39:53,420
I'll show you.

1853
02:40:02,420 --> 02:40:07,420
Shadow of Rizu

1854
02:40:14,420 --> 02:40:16,420
It's a guy like that.

1855
02:40:19,420 --> 02:40:22,420
He was doing something really good.

1856
02:40:22,420 --> 02:40:39,420
I think there are some people who think that the shadow of Shadow Malice is a psyche, but all the details of the story are told here.

1857
02:40:40,420 --> 02:40:44,420
It's like this.

1858
02:40:46,420 --> 02:40:57,420
D is probably the world after YAN destroyed everything.

1859
02:40:58,420 --> 02:41:04,420
It's a character that was sticking together.

1860
02:41:04,420 --> 02:41:18,420
The main story of Shirogaseya was made because of YAN, but the second story is that D is doing it on his own.

1861
02:41:18,420 --> 02:41:24,420
I don't know if there was a shadow of Shirogaseya.

1862
02:41:25,420 --> 02:41:31,420
I think there was a shadow of Shirogaseya and a shadow of Burekani.

1863
02:41:32,420 --> 02:41:37,420
I think there was a shadow of Shirogaseya and Burekani.

1864
02:41:48,420 --> 02:41:54,420
I don't know if there was a shadow of Shirogaseya and Burekani.

1865
02:42:03,420 --> 02:42:07,420
I don't know if there was a shadow of Shirogaseya and Burekani.

1866
02:42:18,420 --> 02:42:22,420
I don't know if there was a shadow of Shirogaseya and Burekani.

1867
02:42:23,420 --> 02:42:32,420
Yan had a score. It was a ridiculous score, but he was using it to show off.

1868
02:42:33,420 --> 02:42:37,420
No one has ever heard of it. It was played in a box.

1869
02:42:38,420 --> 02:42:44,420
It shows what happens in a box. I didn't want to see it, so I didn't go see it.

1870
02:42:45,420 --> 02:42:47,420
After all, it's for use.

1871
02:42:48,420 --> 02:42:52,420
This is the story of the scary score that comes out in the second half.

1872
02:42:52,420 --> 02:42:54,420
Burcarino

1873
02:43:09,420 --> 02:43:12,420
In the old days, everyone had a score.

1874
02:43:13,420 --> 02:43:16,420
Now, no one sings or listens to it.

1875
02:43:17,420 --> 02:43:19,420
It's different from what you hear.

1876
02:43:20,420 --> 02:43:24,420
Gango is an interesting thing. Everything is a shadow of something.

1877
02:43:25,420 --> 02:43:26,420
Of course, of course.

1878
02:43:27,420 --> 02:43:31,420
Sometimes I think that I myself may be a shadow of something.

1879
02:43:32,420 --> 02:43:34,420
Maybe everything is a shadow.

1880
02:43:36,420 --> 02:43:42,420
Burekani's line is a sub-story.

1881
02:43:44,420 --> 02:43:46,420
Was it around the clock?

1882
02:43:47,420 --> 02:43:49,420
It's going to change.

1883
02:43:50,420 --> 02:43:54,420
If you listen to it, you can listen to it for the rest of your life.

1884
02:43:57,420 --> 02:44:01,420
Well then, shall we proceed?

1885
02:44:10,420 --> 02:44:12,420
There is a timing.

1886
02:44:13,420 --> 02:44:15,420
There is a timing.

1887
02:44:19,420 --> 02:44:21,420
Roll it.

1888
02:44:29,420 --> 02:44:34,420
At what time, where is someone?

1889
02:44:35,420 --> 02:44:38,420
It's in my head.

1890
02:44:43,420 --> 02:44:48,420
I don't know if it's there or not, but I think I know right away.

1891
02:44:48,420 --> 02:44:50,420
There is a timing.

1892
02:45:12,420 --> 02:45:14,420
OK, a little more.

1893
02:45:18,420 --> 02:45:20,420
OK, a little more.

1894
02:45:30,420 --> 02:45:32,420
OK, it's here.

1895
02:45:33,420 --> 02:45:34,420
Polo.

1896
02:45:35,420 --> 02:45:38,420
I don't have a poster of a sheep song.

1897
02:45:39,420 --> 02:45:40,420
I want it.

1898
02:45:40,420 --> 02:45:48,420
The poster is often on the bulletin board, but there is something hidden behind the wall because it is a collection of buildings inside.

1899
02:45:49,420 --> 02:45:53,420
This means that Miyanara of Komutei is familiar with this, but they can't talk.

1900
02:45:54,420 --> 02:45:55,420
Do you understand?

1901
02:45:56,420 --> 02:45:57,420
I understand.

1902
02:45:59,420 --> 02:46:02,420
I was able to get four of the hidden bulletin boards.

1903
02:46:06,420 --> 02:46:07,420
No.

1904
02:46:10,420 --> 02:46:11,420
No.

1905
02:46:17,420 --> 02:46:20,420
I hate the bulletin board because I remember it.

1906
02:46:21,420 --> 02:46:24,420
Can you give me one of the special guns you have?

1907
02:46:25,420 --> 02:46:26,420
OK.

1908
02:46:27,420 --> 02:46:28,420
I gave you a special gun.

1909
02:46:29,420 --> 02:46:31,420
Thank you. I can work with this tomorrow.

1910
02:46:31,420 --> 02:46:45,420
The people in this factory are getting weaker and weaker as the main character is getting closer to awakening.

1911
02:46:46,420 --> 02:46:47,420
What happened to the bulletin board?

1912
02:46:48,420 --> 02:46:49,420
I don't want to see the bulletin board.

1913
02:46:50,420 --> 02:46:52,420
We shouldn't have seen the bulletin board.

1914
02:46:53,420 --> 02:46:56,420
What we should have seen was only what was in front of us from the beginning.

1915
02:46:56,420 --> 02:46:59,420
I thought there was another place because I saw it in the bulletin board.

1916
02:47:00,420 --> 02:47:01,420
The other place was a scary place.

1917
02:47:02,420 --> 02:47:03,420
It was a place I shouldn't go.

1918
02:47:04,420 --> 02:47:05,420
I was embarrassed.

1919
02:47:06,420 --> 02:47:08,420
I wondered why I was in such a place.

1920
02:47:09,420 --> 02:47:10,420
I thought it was stupid.

1921
02:47:11,420 --> 02:47:13,420
Then something scary happened.

1922
02:47:14,420 --> 02:47:15,420
I was really scared.

1923
02:47:16,420 --> 02:47:17,420
I was really scared.

1924
02:47:18,420 --> 02:47:19,420
I was scared.

1925
02:47:20,420 --> 02:47:21,420
I was scared.

1926
02:47:22,420 --> 02:47:23,420
I was scared.

1927
02:47:24,420 --> 02:47:25,420
I was scared.

1928
02:47:26,420 --> 02:47:41,760
Well it was the story of the

1929
02:47:42,420 --> 02:47:49,420
sudden escape you said over and over again, even from that event that happened earlier.

1930
02:47:53,420 --> 02:47:54,420
Let's go up there as well.

1931
02:47:56,420 --> 02:48:14,420
It seems that you don't know the machine called me, but the important thing is the stamp.

1932
02:48:14,420 --> 02:48:21,420
You come to my store and put the stamp. I'll give you something in return. That's all.

1933
02:48:21,420 --> 02:48:25,420
It's important to take care of the stamp.

1934
02:48:25,420 --> 02:48:29,420
I'm glad I bought only the stamp.

1935
02:48:32,420 --> 02:48:37,420
I'm not inferior to the tropics. I'm more amazing.

1936
02:48:40,420 --> 02:48:43,420
I'm counting.

1937
02:48:51,420 --> 02:49:02,420
Do you know Chet? It seems to be in the new world. He likes to be in that place.

1938
02:49:02,420 --> 02:49:09,420
That's true, I'm a fisherman. But I like the water more than the shellfish.

1939
02:49:09,420 --> 02:49:11,420
Isn't it okay?

1940
02:49:11,420 --> 02:49:13,420
It tastes like sand.

1941
02:49:13,420 --> 02:49:24,420
The angels of the Maruyama department store are all salarymen.

1942
02:49:24,420 --> 02:49:36,420
They all have their own hobbies.

1943
02:49:36,420 --> 02:49:49,420
Most of the characters in the game have only one role.

1944
02:49:49,420 --> 02:49:54,420
They only speak one line.

1945
02:49:54,420 --> 02:49:58,420
I didn't like that, so I made it like this.

1946
02:49:58,420 --> 02:50:13,420
It's hard to understand because I'm doing it like that.

1947
02:50:13,420 --> 02:50:18,420
Did you find the stamp? Let's press E and A.

1948
02:50:18,420 --> 02:50:25,420
I haven't found it yet. I don't think it's there yet. I'll give it to you.

1949
02:50:25,420 --> 02:50:31,420
This is the water lamp next to the steam bath. I used it as a warehouse in the past.

1950
02:50:31,420 --> 02:50:34,420
The key to the water lamp is here.

1951
02:50:40,420 --> 02:50:45,420
This is the water lamp.

1952
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:57,420
I was sleeping.

1953
02:50:57,420 --> 02:51:03,420
I was sleeping.

1954
02:51:03,420 --> 02:51:09,420
I was sleeping.

1955
02:51:09,420 --> 02:51:15,420
I was sleeping.

1956
02:51:15,420 --> 02:51:24,420
I was sleeping.

1957
02:51:24,420 --> 02:51:28,420
I was sleeping.

1958
02:51:28,420 --> 02:51:32,420
I was sleeping.

1959
02:51:32,420 --> 02:51:36,420
I was sleeping.

1960
02:51:36,420 --> 02:51:40,420
I was sleeping.

1961
02:51:40,420 --> 02:51:42,420
Did you hear me?

1962
02:51:42,420 --> 02:51:47,420
I was sleeping.

1963
02:51:48,420 --> 02:51:52,420
Ms. Tawa.

1964
02:51:52,420 --> 02:51:56,420
I gave it to you, didn't I?

1965
02:51:56,420 --> 02:52:00,420
I didn't give it to you.

1966
02:52:02,420 --> 02:52:06,420
I gave it to you, didn't I?

1967
02:52:12,420 --> 02:52:15,420
I think Ms. Tawa gave it to you, too.

1968
02:52:15,420 --> 02:52:17,420
Is it okay?

1969
02:52:32,220 --> 02:52:34,220
Let's go to the place I can't see.

1970
02:52:46,420 --> 02:52:48,420
Do you know Sen?

1971
02:52:48,420 --> 02:52:52,420
He was living in the house where you are now.

1972
02:52:52,420 --> 02:52:54,420
I wonder where he went.

1973
02:52:54,420 --> 02:53:00,420
There was a machine that liked something big with you.

1974
02:53:00,420 --> 02:53:02,420
It's a strange hobby.

1975
02:53:02,420 --> 02:53:05,420
Is it like you are so active?

1976
02:53:05,420 --> 02:53:12,420
When I look at you, I feel like I'm in front of you, but I feel like I'm far away.

1977
02:53:12,420 --> 02:53:17,420
But if you look at it, you may see us like that.

1978
02:53:17,420 --> 02:53:21,420
I don't like places like that.

1979
02:53:21,420 --> 02:53:24,420
I like places that are close.

1980
02:53:24,420 --> 02:53:26,420
I wonder why.

1981
02:53:42,420 --> 02:53:47,420
I want to go to the 6th floor.

1982
02:53:47,420 --> 02:53:51,420
I don't know anything about the board.

1983
02:53:51,420 --> 02:53:57,420
I'll tell Mr. Sen about it.

1984
02:53:57,420 --> 02:53:59,420
Rin-chan!

1985
02:53:59,420 --> 02:54:01,420
I want to go to the 6th floor.

1986
02:54:01,420 --> 02:54:03,420
I want to go to the 6th floor.

1987
02:54:03,420 --> 02:54:05,420
I want to go to the 6th floor.

1988
02:54:05,420 --> 02:54:07,420
I want to go to the 6th floor.

1989
02:54:08,420 --> 02:54:11,420
I'll tell Mr. Sen.

1990
02:54:11,420 --> 02:54:13,420
Rin-chan!

1991
02:54:13,420 --> 02:54:20,420
That's the Rin-chan from Tata that I heard in the cooling room.

1992
02:54:20,420 --> 02:54:22,420
The round head at the tip of the stick.

1993
02:54:22,420 --> 02:54:24,420
It's cute.

1994
02:54:24,420 --> 02:54:28,420
I wonder how important it was for Tata.

1995
02:54:28,420 --> 02:54:32,420
This is a moss.

1996
02:54:32,420 --> 02:54:41,420
This is a moss that is sold at a souvenir shop.

1997
02:54:41,420 --> 02:54:43,420
Rin-chan.

1998
02:54:47,420 --> 02:54:53,420
When I was little, I loved moss.

1999
02:54:53,420 --> 02:54:56,420
I slept with moss.

2000
02:55:02,420 --> 02:55:06,420
I want to go to the 6th floor.

2001
02:55:06,420 --> 02:55:08,420
I want to go to the 6th floor.

2002
02:55:08,420 --> 02:55:13,420
If it was about the board, I would have known, but you wouldn't tell me anything.

2003
02:55:13,420 --> 02:55:15,420
I'll tell Tsuru.

2004
02:55:15,420 --> 02:55:17,420
I have something to do.

2005
02:55:17,420 --> 02:55:21,420
Can you do it later?

2006
02:55:21,420 --> 02:55:23,420
I'll tell Tsuru.

2007
02:55:31,420 --> 02:55:32,420
Tsuru.

2008
02:55:32,420 --> 02:55:36,420
What do you want to know about the hidden board?

2009
02:55:36,420 --> 02:55:38,420
Experimental engineering?

2010
02:55:38,420 --> 02:55:42,420
Are you looking for a shadow?

2011
02:55:42,420 --> 02:55:43,420
I'll give you this.

2012
02:55:43,420 --> 02:55:46,420
I hope you find the shadow.

2013
02:55:46,420 --> 02:55:48,420
Old design.

2014
02:55:51,420 --> 02:55:53,420
Let's see.

2015
02:55:56,420 --> 02:55:58,420
This is it.

2016
02:56:01,420 --> 02:56:04,420
Well then.

2017
02:56:08,420 --> 02:56:11,420
Let's put in some water.

2018
02:56:21,420 --> 02:56:23,420
Let's put in some water.

2019
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:33,420
Let's put in some water.

2020
02:56:39,420 --> 02:56:41,420
Let's put in some water.

2021
02:56:51,420 --> 02:56:54,420
You're the one who wants to know.

2022
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:56,420
But don't ask me.

2023
02:56:56,420 --> 02:56:59,420
I'm satisfied just being with Liz.

2024
02:56:59,420 --> 02:57:03,420
It's not right to want to know something you like.

2025
02:57:03,420 --> 02:57:06,420
You're not going to make it worse.

2026
02:57:06,420 --> 02:57:09,420
You're not going to make it worse.

2027
02:57:09,420 --> 02:57:12,420
I'm satisfied just being with Liz.

2028
02:57:12,420 --> 02:57:15,420
I'm satisfied just being with Liz.

2029
02:57:15,420 --> 02:57:18,420
I'm satisfied just being with Liz.

2030
02:57:18,420 --> 02:57:21,420
You're not going to make it worse.

2031
02:57:21,420 --> 02:57:24,420
You're not going to make it worse.

2032
02:57:24,420 --> 02:57:31,420
There's a poster on the top left.

2033
02:57:31,420 --> 02:57:35,420
This is a poster for Shadow Matters.

2034
02:57:35,420 --> 02:57:38,420
There's something on it.

2035
02:57:38,420 --> 02:57:41,420
Liz's shadow.

2036
02:57:41,420 --> 02:57:45,420
These two have deep darkness.

2037
02:57:49,420 --> 02:57:52,420
Liz's shadow.

2038
02:57:52,420 --> 02:57:55,420
Can you see it?

2039
02:57:55,420 --> 02:57:58,420
I can't see it.

2040
02:57:58,420 --> 02:58:02,420
I'm trying to breathe.

2041
02:58:02,420 --> 02:58:05,420
Only one of them has been removed.

2042
02:58:05,420 --> 02:58:07,420
It can't move.

2043
02:58:07,420 --> 02:58:10,420
The machine can't move normally.

2044
02:58:10,420 --> 02:58:13,420
Liz's shadow.

2045
02:58:13,420 --> 02:58:16,420
Liz's shadow.

2046
02:58:17,420 --> 02:58:20,420
That's what it looks like.

2047
02:58:30,420 --> 02:58:33,420
Please imagine it.

2048
02:58:37,420 --> 02:58:40,420
A box.

2049
02:58:46,420 --> 02:58:49,420
A box.

2050
02:58:53,420 --> 02:58:56,420
Ta-da!

2051
02:58:56,420 --> 02:58:59,420
I got a normal song score.

2052
02:59:07,420 --> 02:59:12,420
Now the road is open.

2053
02:59:12,420 --> 02:59:15,420
I'm going to talk to Liz.

2054
02:59:21,420 --> 02:59:24,420
I got the key.

2055
02:59:24,420 --> 02:59:28,420
Why are you asking me that?

2056
02:59:28,420 --> 02:59:32,420
You have something strange.

2057
02:59:32,420 --> 02:59:34,420
I have nothing.

2058
02:59:34,420 --> 02:59:39,420
Until I made the soul wall, there was something like a secret.

2059
02:59:39,420 --> 02:59:42,420
But I can't feel anything right now.

2060
02:59:42,420 --> 02:59:45,420
It's easy to say I don't feel anything.

2061
02:59:45,420 --> 02:59:47,420
I think I understand now.

2062
02:59:47,420 --> 02:59:51,420
Why did no one need words?

2063
02:59:54,420 --> 02:59:57,420
Takashi is gone.

2064
03:00:03,420 --> 03:00:06,420
This is...

2065
03:00:06,420 --> 03:00:09,420
It's going to be a long journey.

2066
03:00:12,420 --> 03:00:15,420
Let's recover the soul wall.

2067
03:00:36,420 --> 03:00:39,420
Let's go.

2068
03:01:07,420 --> 03:01:10,420
He's gone.

2069
03:01:17,420 --> 03:01:21,360
The

2070
03:01:36,420 --> 03:01:46,420
My mother gave me an air-conditioner.

2071
03:01:46,420 --> 03:01:51,420
Fuhi, Fuhi, Fuhi, I'll give you this.

2072
03:01:51,420 --> 03:01:54,420
She gave me an air-conditioner.

2073
03:01:54,420 --> 03:02:04,420
Fuhi, isn't it rare? I don't know what it is.

2074
03:02:04,420 --> 03:02:05,420
I don't know.

2075
03:02:07,420 --> 03:02:10,420
There is a smokey.

2076
03:02:15,420 --> 03:02:18,420
There are no sheep in this world.

2077
03:02:29,420 --> 03:02:30,420
Let's go.

2078
03:02:34,420 --> 03:02:37,420
There are no sheep in this world.

2079
03:02:46,420 --> 03:02:47,420
Here it comes.

2080
03:02:52,420 --> 03:02:53,420
Coppel.

2081
03:02:54,420 --> 03:02:56,420
The color of the flame is good.

2082
03:02:57,420 --> 03:03:01,420
It doesn't matter what I do.

2083
03:03:02,420 --> 03:03:05,420
It doesn't matter what you do.

2084
03:03:26,420 --> 03:03:31,420
I think it looks big.

2085
03:03:32,420 --> 03:03:35,420
It's like a lift.

2086
03:03:36,420 --> 03:03:38,420
It's going up.

2087
03:03:39,420 --> 03:03:44,420
Actually, the location of this area is the location of the car, so it's getting bigger.

2088
03:03:46,420 --> 03:03:48,420
Oh, it's yellow.

2089
03:03:56,420 --> 03:03:59,420
This is a water research center.

2090
03:04:00,420 --> 03:04:08,420
If you put together some of the things that have been explained so far about water, you can see that it is a waste of water and gas.

2091
03:04:09,420 --> 03:04:13,420
However, the water component changes slightly depending on the individual.

2092
03:04:14,420 --> 03:04:18,420
The water component changes slightly depending on the individual.

2093
03:04:19,420 --> 03:04:23,420
The water component changes slightly depending on the individual.

2094
03:04:23,420 --> 03:04:26,420
The water component changes slightly depending on the individual.

2095
03:04:27,420 --> 03:04:31,420
It is thought that this is due to the difference in the type of water vapor that has been absorbed.

2096
03:04:32,420 --> 03:04:42,420
Also, pure liquid can be obtained by the production of water, but strictly speaking, it is thought that there is a water that is highly effective against each machine and a water that is not.

2097
03:04:43,420 --> 03:04:52,420
If you can produce the pure liquid of the most suitable component for each machine, the effect will be significantly increased.

2098
03:04:54,420 --> 03:04:56,420
It would have been nice to put this in the game.

2099
03:04:57,420 --> 03:04:59,420
The pure liquid of the most suitable component.

2100
03:05:00,420 --> 03:05:03,420
2. Water is the source of all existence.

2101
03:05:04,420 --> 03:05:09,420
All things are born from water, or all things are born from water.

2102
03:05:10,420 --> 03:05:14,420
All water vapor, all parts, all machines, and water.

2103
03:05:15,420 --> 03:05:19,420
It is a surprising fact that all of these are produced from water.

2104
03:05:19,420 --> 03:05:20,420
It is a surprising fact that all of these are produced from water.

2105
03:05:21,420 --> 03:05:22,420
Probably, there is a will in water.

2106
03:05:23,420 --> 03:05:30,420
It may be that the will we think of is different from the case, but we cannot explain this function of water unless we define such a will.

2107
03:05:31,420 --> 03:05:36,420
We are all just children of water that have changed their shape.

2108
03:05:37,420 --> 03:05:43,420
3. The chemical components of water contain essential components to maintain pure concentration.

2109
03:05:44,420 --> 03:05:48,420
Therefore, we cannot live without water.

2110
03:05:49,420 --> 03:05:51,420
All machines depend on water.

2111
03:05:52,420 --> 03:05:56,420
We, who are born from water, cannot leave water.

2112
03:05:57,420 --> 03:05:58,420
We can only go back to water.

2113
03:05:59,420 --> 03:06:01,420
There is only one possibility.

2114
03:06:04,420 --> 03:06:06,420
Research on water.

2115
03:06:08,420 --> 03:06:12,420
The game with a large number of general texts.

2116
03:06:12,420 --> 03:06:16,420
4. Shadows.

2117
03:06:17,420 --> 03:06:20,420
Shadows are our avatar, or our form.

2118
03:06:21,420 --> 03:06:23,420
Shadows have several stages.

2119
03:06:24,420 --> 03:06:27,420
The most common one is called a shadow original.

2120
03:06:28,420 --> 03:06:30,420
It is the first stage of being born in a garage.

2121
03:06:31,420 --> 03:06:34,420
At this stage, it basically changes into several forms.

2122
03:06:35,420 --> 03:06:46,420
The fact that shadows have been living in a garage for a long time has become clear by observing with an aurascope.

2123
03:06:47,420 --> 03:06:53,420
This aurascope is the one that Chen was looking at in the new world.

2124
03:06:57,420 --> 03:06:59,420
We call this stage the ethyl shadow.

2125
03:07:00,420 --> 03:07:03,420
The ethyl shadow is an individual shadow.

2126
03:07:04,420 --> 03:07:05,420
In fact, it is unknown.

2127
03:07:06,420 --> 03:07:10,420
The shadow that is someone else's shadow is the ethyl shadow.

2128
03:07:11,420 --> 03:07:13,420
Also, it is a shadow that changes in the opposite direction.

2129
03:07:14,420 --> 03:07:18,420
However, in order for this change to happen, a special profession is required.

2130
03:07:19,420 --> 03:07:21,420
It cannot be changed by its own power.

2131
03:07:22,420 --> 03:07:24,420
That is our role as machines.

2132
03:07:25,420 --> 03:07:31,420
The ethyl shadow is the original version of the garage.

2133
03:07:32,420 --> 03:07:42,420
I wanted to make the original version of the ethyl shadow look like an RPG.

2134
03:07:42,420 --> 03:07:43,420
The ethyl shadow is a shadow that is not visible.

2135
03:07:44,420 --> 03:07:50,420
As an enemy of the ethyl shadow, it is said that you have to fight the ethyl shadow with an aurascope.

2136
03:07:51,420 --> 03:07:54,420
It is a reflection of the ethyl shadow.

2137
03:07:55,420 --> 03:07:57,420
What is even more scary is the dark shadow.

2138
03:07:58,420 --> 03:08:04,420
It is said that if you do not defeat the press machine, you will not be able to come here.

2139
03:08:05,420 --> 03:08:07,420
There was such a setting.

2140
03:08:07,420 --> 03:08:08,420
I made it.

2141
03:08:11,420 --> 03:08:14,420
It is a shadow that can not be seen normally.

2142
03:08:15,420 --> 03:08:17,420
I can not attach an aurascope.

2143
03:08:19,420 --> 03:08:21,420
This is a shadow.

2144
03:08:22,420 --> 03:08:23,420
This is the AIN room.

2145
03:08:30,420 --> 03:08:36,420
This is also very nice compared to the original version.

2146
03:08:38,420 --> 03:08:42,420
This is here.

2147
03:08:47,420 --> 03:08:56,420
The press machine is stopped and the bridge is moving.

2148
03:08:57,420 --> 03:09:01,420
This is the output of the whole.

2149
03:09:02,420 --> 03:09:05,420
If you do this, it will stop all.

2150
03:09:07,420 --> 03:09:08,420
All valves.

2151
03:09:09,420 --> 03:09:26,420
Raise the valve and the press machine passes through it.

2152
03:09:27,420 --> 03:09:31,420
The bridge that goes from here will move.

2153
03:09:38,420 --> 03:09:41,420
What should I do?

2154
03:09:53,420 --> 03:09:55,420
There is only a whole.

2155
03:10:07,420 --> 03:10:26,420
There is no sheep song, but that is probably the song of Coppé.

2156
03:10:26,420 --> 03:10:41,420
It seems that it is close to something that does not understand the reason.

2157
03:10:42,420 --> 03:10:44,420
Let's check the wind.

2158
03:10:48,420 --> 03:10:50,420
I did not check the wind.

2159
03:10:57,420 --> 03:11:14,420
It must have been controlled by the melody of the sheep song.

2160
03:11:17,420 --> 03:11:19,420
Is it true?

2161
03:11:19,420 --> 03:11:24,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2162
03:11:42,420 --> 03:11:45,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2163
03:11:45,420 --> 03:11:48,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2164
03:12:15,420 --> 03:12:19,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2165
03:12:45,420 --> 03:12:48,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2166
03:13:15,420 --> 03:13:18,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2167
03:13:45,420 --> 03:13:48,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2168
03:14:15,420 --> 03:14:18,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2169
03:14:45,420 --> 03:14:48,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2170
03:14:51,420 --> 03:14:54,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2171
03:14:54,420 --> 03:14:57,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2172
03:15:13,420 --> 03:15:16,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2173
03:15:24,420 --> 03:15:27,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2174
03:15:28,420 --> 03:15:31,420
This is the back door of the main store in Shirogase.

2175
03:15:54,420 --> 03:15:57,420
This is the back door of Shirogase.

2176
03:16:18,420 --> 03:16:21,420
This is the back door of Shirogase.

2177
03:16:24,420 --> 03:16:29,420
This is the place where the old house was built.

2178
03:16:31,420 --> 03:16:34,420
Let's talk about the old house later.

2179
03:16:40,420 --> 03:16:42,420
This kind of storage room.

2180
03:16:46,420 --> 03:16:47,420
It's quiet.

2181
03:16:55,420 --> 03:16:56,420
The third floor.

2182
03:17:10,420 --> 03:17:11,420
The third floor.

2183
03:17:12,420 --> 03:17:13,420
The fourth floor.

2184
03:17:14,420 --> 03:17:16,420
He's not me. He's not inside me.

2185
03:17:17,420 --> 03:17:19,420
He's a hole. He's a hole that sucks me in.

2186
03:17:20,420 --> 03:17:21,420
The fourth floor.

2187
03:17:24,420 --> 03:17:25,420
The fourth floor.

2188
03:17:30,420 --> 03:17:32,420
The gas is excellent.

2189
03:17:33,420 --> 03:17:34,420
We can't say it's our fuel.

2190
03:17:35,420 --> 03:17:40,420
It's possible to increase our output and gravity by modifying it.

2191
03:17:41,420 --> 03:17:45,420
But the possibility of the main fuel itself is not left behind.

2192
03:17:46,420 --> 03:17:49,420
As an example of one that proves its possibility,

2193
03:17:50,420 --> 03:17:52,420
I have a gas station that Coppel developed.

2194
03:17:52,420 --> 03:18:00,420
The gas station was used as an additional fuel to increase our output.

2195
03:18:01,420 --> 03:18:07,420
What we need to produce the gas station is GEPERIA CODOTTI, which is a toxic substance that is contained in the body of GEDO.

2196
03:18:08,420 --> 03:18:10,420
There are three of them.

2197
03:18:11,420 --> 03:18:16,420
GEPERIA CODOTTI, which is needed for the first gas station, can be extracted from about 20 GEDO.

2198
03:18:17,420 --> 03:18:20,420
But GEPERIA CODOTTI's extraction work is very delicate.

2199
03:18:21,420 --> 03:18:23,420
It is difficult for something other than me to be implemented.

2200
03:18:25,420 --> 03:18:31,420
However, the combustion energy of the gas station that was turned on at 1 to 10 is about three times that of the gas station.

2201
03:18:32,420 --> 03:18:36,420
The opportunity to break down due to rapid temperature rise and high compression has been exhausted.

2202
03:18:37,420 --> 03:18:41,420
As far as I know, there is only one machine that can withstand this.

2203
03:18:42,420 --> 03:18:49,420
If you want to think about practical use in the future, you have to improve the quality of the gas station.

2204
03:18:50,420 --> 03:18:53,420
I went to a gas station teacher.

2205
03:18:54,420 --> 03:19:07,420
This event, the original version, was an event to make nitro, but the complete version has been changed to a gas station.

2206
03:19:08,420 --> 03:19:15,420
When I was originally making the original version, do you know what a drag race is?

2207
03:19:16,420 --> 03:19:32,420
There is a race in the United States where a very thick tire is attached and the front is very long and you can run in 0.4 seconds.

2208
03:19:32,420 --> 03:19:39,420
At that time, nitro is added to the fuel and run.

2209
03:19:40,420 --> 03:19:48,420
However, nitro is a completely different substance from nitroglycerin.

2210
03:19:49,420 --> 03:19:58,420
At that time, nitro was said to be the same as nitroglycerin, but there was no research on whether it was the same as nitroglycerin.

2211
03:19:58,420 --> 03:20:05,420
At that time, there was no research on how to make nitro, so there was no information on how to make it.

2212
03:20:06,420 --> 03:20:15,420
I thought it was okay to make nitroglycerin, but at that time there was no information on how to make it.

2213
03:20:15,420 --> 03:20:25,420
I thought it was okay to make the complete version, but at that time there was no information on how to make it.

2214
03:20:26,420 --> 03:20:35,420
I thought it was okay to make the complete version, but at that time there was no information on how to make it.

2215
03:20:35,420 --> 03:20:47,420
So I decided to make it an original liquid, and this time it became a temporary liquid with an original liquid.

2216
03:20:48,420 --> 03:21:01,420
However, nitro is also used as an anti-inflammatory drug, so I thought it might be surprisingly good, but it was a temporary liquid because I wanted to make it an original.

2217
03:21:01,420 --> 03:21:08,420
The color of the liquid is green, but the color of the liquid is red.

2218
03:21:09,420 --> 03:21:15,420
This is called Geperiacotin.

2219
03:21:16,420 --> 03:21:37,420
Geperiacotin is a substance that is often used as a name for a plant, and it is a name that uses Gedo and Coppel's words as an anagram.

2220
03:21:38,420 --> 03:21:50,420
Geperiacotin is a substance that is often used as a name for a plant, and it is a name that uses Gedo and Coppel's words as an anagram.

2221
03:21:51,420 --> 03:21:58,420
This is something I found nostalgic. I wrote it down.

2222
03:21:59,420 --> 03:22:02,420
You're trying to make a light liquid, aren't you?

2223
03:22:03,420 --> 03:22:07,420
This is a very dangerous anti-inflammatory.

2224
03:22:08,420 --> 03:22:15,420
If you make a mistake in both ways, it will only be disassembled, but if you treat it carefully, it will be effective. If you are interested, you can collect 20 Gedo.

2225
03:22:18,420 --> 03:22:20,420
I took 20 Gedo for this purpose.

2226
03:22:21,420 --> 03:22:23,420
It looks like it's ready. Wait a minute.

2227
03:22:24,420 --> 03:22:28,420
This is Geperiacotin. Be careful not to make a mistake.

2228
03:22:29,420 --> 03:22:31,420
I got Geperiacotin.

2229
03:22:32,420 --> 03:22:34,420
Let's make it.

2230
03:22:53,420 --> 03:22:55,420
This is Geperiacotin.

2231
03:22:55,420 --> 03:22:57,420
This is Geperiacotin.

2232
03:23:20,420 --> 03:23:22,420
I only have what I need.

2233
03:23:25,420 --> 03:23:35,420
This is a substance that requires the production of a new world.

2234
03:23:46,420 --> 03:23:49,420
I like the shape of this end.

2235
03:23:50,420 --> 03:23:56,420
I touched it with a lot of spirit.

2236
03:24:10,420 --> 03:24:13,420
Let's go see the Chapsis system.

2237
03:24:19,420 --> 03:24:21,420
This is the Chapsis system.

2238
03:24:33,420 --> 03:24:36,420
I wonder if it's okay to put it on first.

2239
03:24:46,420 --> 03:24:48,420
It's ready.

2240
03:24:50,420 --> 03:24:52,420
It's here.

2241
03:24:57,420 --> 03:24:59,420
Let's listen to the story.

2242
03:25:02,420 --> 03:25:06,420
The shadow of the mountain. You don't need to know.

2243
03:25:08,420 --> 03:25:15,420
This green color contains liquid, but this is a semi-permanent liquid.

2244
03:25:19,420 --> 03:25:21,420
The shadow of the mountain.

2245
03:25:25,420 --> 03:25:28,420
The shadow of the mountain. Don't come because you're scared.

2246
03:25:29,420 --> 03:25:34,420
The shadow has the opposite properties of the machine.

2247
03:25:35,420 --> 03:25:38,420
It is preserved in a semi-permanent liquid.

2248
03:25:40,420 --> 03:25:44,420
The semi-permanent liquid is like a semi-permanent liquid for the shadow.

2249
03:25:45,420 --> 03:25:47,420
The shadow of Reiko.

2250
03:25:48,420 --> 03:25:50,420
The doll is here.

2251
03:25:53,420 --> 03:25:59,420
The name of the mountain is written here.

2252
03:26:15,420 --> 03:26:20,420
What is this uneasiness? What makes me suffer?

2253
03:26:21,420 --> 03:26:24,420
There is no place for me even though so much power overflows.

2254
03:26:25,420 --> 03:26:27,420
I am crushed by my power.

2255
03:26:28,420 --> 03:26:30,420
The old eyes are also impetuous.

2256
03:26:36,420 --> 03:26:38,420
The Chapsis system.

2257
03:26:39,420 --> 03:26:41,420
It's not open yet.

2258
03:26:44,420 --> 03:26:47,420
I don't know the fate of the Chapsis system.

2259
03:26:50,420 --> 03:26:51,420
The Chapsis system.

2260
03:26:53,420 --> 03:26:55,420
It's open.

2261
03:26:57,420 --> 03:26:59,420
The Chapsis system.

2262
03:27:01,420 --> 03:27:03,420
The Chapsis system.

2263
03:27:05,420 --> 03:27:07,420
The Chapsis system.

2264
03:27:09,420 --> 03:27:11,420
The Chapsis system.

2265
03:27:11,420 --> 03:27:15,420
I came to see you.

2266
03:27:20,420 --> 03:27:26,420
The atmosphere of this wall is wonderful.

2267
03:27:29,420 --> 03:27:33,420
The 3D modeler worked hard to make it.

2268
03:27:33,420 --> 03:27:37,420
I was waiting for you.

2269
03:27:37,420 --> 03:27:41,420
I want to hear about the shadow.

2270
03:27:41,420 --> 03:27:45,420
But I have just become your boss.

2271
03:27:45,420 --> 03:27:49,420
It will take a little longer.

2272
03:27:49,420 --> 03:27:53,420
I want you to do something in the meantime.

2273
03:27:53,420 --> 03:27:57,420
I want you to get something back.

2274
03:27:57,420 --> 03:28:01,420
It is my dream diary.

2275
03:28:01,420 --> 03:28:05,420
Please rent an apartment in the BIS related to Seiryu Village.

2276
03:28:05,420 --> 03:28:09,420
There is a letter and a telescope in the drawer.

2277
03:28:09,420 --> 03:28:13,420
If you give a letter to the BIS, you will be able to rent a room.

2278
03:28:13,420 --> 03:28:17,420
Do you understand?

2279
03:28:17,420 --> 03:28:21,420
Yes, please.

2280
03:28:21,420 --> 03:28:25,420
I got a letter and a telescope.

2281
03:28:25,420 --> 03:28:29,420
What should I do?

2282
03:28:29,420 --> 03:28:33,420
It's a good time.

2283
03:28:39,420 --> 03:28:43,420
It's been a long time.

2284
03:28:43,420 --> 03:28:47,420
Do you still hate me?

2285
03:28:47,420 --> 03:28:51,420
I had no choice at that time.

2286
03:28:51,420 --> 03:28:55,420
I came to you.

2287
03:28:55,420 --> 03:28:59,420
Please give me a room to observe you.

2288
03:29:15,420 --> 03:29:19,420
What should I do?

2289
03:29:19,420 --> 03:29:23,420
I'm in a hurry.

2290
03:29:27,420 --> 03:29:31,420
I can't finish tomorrow.

2291
03:29:31,420 --> 03:29:35,420
I have to go three times.

2292
03:29:35,420 --> 03:29:39,420
What should I do?

2293
03:29:39,420 --> 03:29:43,420
I wanted to go to Fune.

2294
03:29:43,420 --> 03:29:47,420
Isn't it too late?

2295
03:29:47,420 --> 03:29:51,420
I will go to Fune.

2296
03:29:51,420 --> 03:29:55,420
I will go to Fune.

2297
03:29:55,420 --> 03:29:59,420
I will go to Fune.

2298
03:29:59,420 --> 03:30:03,420
There are many hearts.

2299
03:30:03,420 --> 03:30:07,420
I will go to Fune.

2300
03:30:07,420 --> 03:30:11,420
I will go to Fune.

2301
03:30:17,420 --> 03:30:21,420
What should I do?

2302
03:30:25,420 --> 03:30:29,420
I will go to Fune.

2303
03:30:29,420 --> 03:30:33,420
I wanted to go to Fune.

2304
03:30:33,420 --> 03:30:37,420
I will go to Fune.

2305
03:30:37,420 --> 03:30:41,420
I want to go to Fune.

2306
03:30:41,420 --> 03:30:45,420
I will go to Fune.

2307
03:30:45,420 --> 03:30:49,420
I will go to Fune.

2308
03:30:55,420 --> 03:30:59,420
There are two floors on the right.

2309
03:30:59,420 --> 03:31:03,420
There are many other places.

2310
03:31:03,420 --> 03:31:10,220
It's complicated, but I'm here right now, and this is the second floor of the White House.

2311
03:31:13,880 --> 03:31:15,880
The place of the final battle.

2312
03:31:25,220 --> 03:31:27,220
Can I go home?

2313
03:31:30,400 --> 03:31:32,400
Is it dangerous?

2314
03:31:33,420 --> 03:31:35,420
Oh, I forgot to listen to a line.

2315
03:31:48,420 --> 03:31:50,420
I'll just listen to the lines of the lines.

2316
03:31:56,420 --> 03:31:58,420
I can't talk about this.

2317
03:31:59,420 --> 03:32:01,420
What I do has nothing to do with you.

2318
03:32:01,420 --> 03:32:03,420
What you do has nothing to do with me.

2319
03:32:09,420 --> 03:32:12,420
I'll just listen to the lines of the two of you and go back.

2320
03:32:18,420 --> 03:32:20,420
A letter of dream?

2321
03:32:20,420 --> 03:32:22,420
You asked me to give it to you, didn't you?

2322
03:32:22,420 --> 03:32:24,420
That letter was sent by me.

2323
03:32:24,420 --> 03:32:26,420
It's the letter from before.

2324
03:32:26,420 --> 03:32:28,420
It was a letter I gave to you.

2325
03:32:56,420 --> 03:32:58,420
It's good to leave alone.

2326
03:33:14,420 --> 03:33:16,420
Who's on the wrong side?

2327
03:33:21,420 --> 03:33:23,420
Is it。。.

2328
03:33:26,420 --> 03:33:50,080
Instead of setting B, change D and A to create an

2329
03:33:50,080 --> 03:34:04,700
The movement of the

2330
03:34:04,700 --> 03:34:07,700
This is the final Bindofen.

2331
03:34:23,700 --> 03:34:28,700
I want to give my mother a red can.

2332
03:34:28,700 --> 03:34:33,700
Can you give me a red can you have?

2333
03:34:34,700 --> 03:34:37,700
Thank you. I can work tomorrow.

2334
03:34:38,700 --> 03:34:40,700
Will I make it in time?

2335
03:34:41,700 --> 03:34:42,700
I made it.

2336
03:34:43,700 --> 03:34:45,700
Poor juice.

2337
03:34:46,700 --> 03:34:49,700
I can't do anything today. It's hard. I can't do anything.

2338
03:34:50,700 --> 03:34:53,700
My hands are just hanging. It's just heavy.

2339
03:34:54,700 --> 03:34:57,700
My head is just on it. It's just heavy.

2340
03:34:58,700 --> 03:35:00,700
I can't move because it's heavy.

2341
03:35:01,700 --> 03:35:03,700
It's already broken.

2342
03:35:09,700 --> 03:35:11,700
Let's recover once.

2343
03:35:21,700 --> 03:35:23,700
Well, now.

2344
03:35:29,700 --> 03:35:31,700
I can't do anything.

2345
03:35:44,700 --> 03:35:46,700
Hello.

2346
03:35:47,700 --> 03:35:49,700
What should I do with the route?

2347
03:35:50,700 --> 03:35:52,700
I can't do anything.

2348
03:35:57,700 --> 03:36:01,700
I was thinking of doing two routes if possible.

2349
03:36:02,700 --> 03:36:04,700
What should I do?

2350
03:36:04,700 --> 03:36:06,700
I can't do anything.

2351
03:36:15,700 --> 03:36:17,700
There are various ways to start.

2352
03:36:18,700 --> 03:36:20,700
But I can't do anything.

2353
03:36:21,700 --> 03:36:23,700
Who is Fushike?

2354
03:36:24,700 --> 03:36:26,700
I'm not stupid.

2355
03:36:29,700 --> 03:36:31,700
I'm always stupid.

2356
03:36:31,700 --> 03:36:33,700
I don't want to talk.

2357
03:36:38,700 --> 03:36:41,700
At first, I said that I knew about Fushike.

2358
03:36:46,700 --> 03:36:48,700
I'm always stupid.

2359
03:36:53,700 --> 03:36:57,700
I want to hear various things, but the sound is...

2360
03:36:58,700 --> 03:37:02,700
It seems to be soundless, so I will recover first.

2361
03:37:24,700 --> 03:37:26,700
I want you to do multiple routes.

2362
03:37:27,700 --> 03:37:30,700
I will definitely do the juice route.

2363
03:37:34,700 --> 03:37:36,700
The juice route is fixed.

2364
03:37:37,700 --> 03:37:42,700
I'm a little worried if I'll do it again before that.

2365
03:37:43,700 --> 03:37:46,700
Can I put the sound in?

2366
03:37:47,700 --> 03:37:49,700
I'll take off the seat for a moment.

2367
03:37:58,700 --> 03:38:00,700
This is fine.

2368
03:38:01,700 --> 03:38:03,700
But now it's...

2369
03:38:07,700 --> 03:38:09,700
The thing here is not working.

2370
03:38:10,700 --> 03:38:16,700
Please change settings from the top down.

2371
03:38:21,700 --> 03:38:23,700
Play Fushike.

2372
03:38:57,720 --> 03:38:59,080
It was the finish line so I made it on the track�리

2373
03:39:22,560 --> 03:39:24,860
I made it!

2374
03:39:24,860 --> 03:39:26,360
Thank you for watching

2375
03:39:26,360 --> 03:39:41,440
If you want to do it, I wonder if it's for road use and juice.

2376
03:39:43,440 --> 03:39:46,440
If you go at this pace ...

2377
03:39:46,520 --> 03:39:54,520
Even if I do it with that, I wonder if it will end in three days. It looks like it will end.

2378
03:39:54,520 --> 03:39:57,520
Today is the first day, isn't it?

2379
03:39:57,520 --> 03:40:02,520
Ah, but it's a long way from Rokusho.

2380
03:40:02,520 --> 03:40:06,520
I wonder if I can do it.

2381
03:40:06,520 --> 03:40:11,520
I want to finish it if I can do it three times.

2382
03:40:11,600 --> 03:40:16,600
I wonder if I can do it.

2383
03:40:16,600 --> 03:40:18,600
I might do it.

2384
03:40:18,600 --> 03:40:21,600
I will announce it tomorrow.

2385
03:40:21,600 --> 03:40:23,600
Gimno.

2386
03:40:23,600 --> 03:40:26,600
Do you know Uzumete frog?

2387
03:40:26,600 --> 03:40:29,600
No.

2388
03:40:29,600 --> 03:40:32,600
It seems to be a pretty big frog of some kind.

2389
03:40:32,600 --> 03:40:35,600
Don't you often get a needle out of the frog's belly?

2390
03:40:35,600 --> 03:40:40,600
So it seems that this guy has a very unusual needle.

2391
03:40:40,680 --> 03:40:47,680
But it seems to be a pretty big one, so I wonder if I can catch it unless I use a fairly large needle.

2392
03:40:54,680 --> 03:40:58,680
I wonder if the needle that comes out of the belly is the one that is torn apart.

2393
03:40:58,680 --> 03:41:03,680
This guy ... Ah, I see, the fishing method hasn't changed at all.

2394
03:41:10,680 --> 03:41:13,680
Let's see ...

2395
03:41:13,680 --> 03:41:16,680
Well ...

2396
03:41:16,680 --> 03:41:19,680
Then ...

2397
03:41:19,680 --> 03:41:24,680
I have a fishing rod, so ...

2398
03:41:24,680 --> 03:41:27,680
Shall we go?

2399
03:41:40,680 --> 03:41:43,680
All right.

2400
03:41:43,760 --> 03:41:46,760
All right.

2401
03:41:46,840 --> 03:41:49,840
All right.

2402
03:42:08,840 --> 03:42:13,840
Oh, let's go to the pirate camp first.

2403
03:42:16,840 --> 03:42:19,840
What is this?

2404
03:42:19,840 --> 03:42:24,840
As you can see, it's a Chinese room.

2405
03:42:24,840 --> 03:42:27,840
Well ...

2406
03:42:27,840 --> 03:42:30,840
What is this?

2407
03:42:30,840 --> 03:42:33,840
Expand the bar of the engine.

2408
03:42:33,840 --> 03:42:36,840
Make the piston bigger.

2409
03:42:36,840 --> 03:42:39,840
I will install it with Moriaki.

2410
03:42:39,840 --> 03:42:42,840
Oil cooler.

2411
03:42:42,920 --> 03:42:46,920
This is to increase the surface area of ​​the circulation of the circulation.

2412
03:42:46,920 --> 03:42:50,920
It is a thing that cools the circulation of the engine.

2413
03:42:50,920 --> 03:42:53,920
If the engine is too hot, your body will break.

2414
03:42:53,920 --> 03:42:56,920
I will install it with Moriaki.

2415
03:42:56,920 --> 03:42:58,920
This is ...

2416
03:42:58,920 --> 03:43:12,120
It's a

2417
03:43:12,120 --> 03:43:15,120
thing that cools the circulation of the circulation of the engine.

2418
03:43:15,120 --> 03:43:18,120
I will install it with Moriaki.

2419
03:43:18,120 --> 03:43:21,120
I will install it with Moriaki.

2420
03:43:21,120 --> 03:43:24,120
Let's go to see Chen.

2421
03:43:43,120 --> 03:43:46,120
I'm going to go to the room where Chen is.

2422
03:43:46,120 --> 03:43:49,120
I will go later.

2423
03:43:49,120 --> 03:43:53,120
You can see the code that I put in the first in the first ...

2424
03:43:53,120 --> 03:43:56,120
You can see the code that I put in the first ...

2425
03:43:56,120 --> 03:43:59,120
I want to read the lines this time, so I'm going to go to the room where Chen is.

2426
03:44:12,120 --> 03:44:17,120
Originally, change the gear at that timing.

2427
03:44:27,120 --> 03:44:29,120
It's coming.

2428
03:44:29,120 --> 03:44:31,120
It's coming.

2429
03:44:39,120 --> 03:44:47,120
I like to enjoy doing this kind of quest without cheating.

2430
03:44:49,120 --> 03:44:52,120
This time, I'll prioritize the text.

2431
03:44:53,120 --> 03:44:56,120
Pusike's diary. I don't have such a thing.

2432
03:44:56,120 --> 03:44:59,120
What I have is Juice's diary.

2433
03:44:59,120 --> 03:45:03,120
What he wants to get back is the same as this.

2434
03:45:03,120 --> 03:45:07,120
Hey, don't you have a fire extinguisher?

2435
03:45:07,120 --> 03:45:10,120
It seems that it was made in the warehouse in the back of the factory.

2436
03:45:10,120 --> 03:45:14,120
In order to go to the warehouse, the movable mirror should not go up.

2437
03:45:14,120 --> 03:45:18,120
There should be a device that can operate that bridge somewhere.

2438
03:45:18,120 --> 03:45:24,120
If you move that bridge and bring the fire extinguisher, you can think about it.

2439
03:45:24,120 --> 03:45:27,120
Oh, I think you have it. Give it to me.

2440
03:45:27,120 --> 03:45:30,120
If you give it to me, I won't be able to read the lines.

2441
03:45:30,120 --> 03:45:32,120
Why? Don't you need a diary?

2442
03:45:32,120 --> 03:45:34,120
Give it to me quickly.

2443
03:45:36,120 --> 03:45:40,120
But why are you listening to Pusike?

2444
03:45:40,120 --> 03:45:44,120
When I asked him for a favor, he didn't say anything.

2445
03:45:44,120 --> 03:45:46,120
Well, it has nothing to do with me.

2446
03:45:46,120 --> 03:45:51,120
Why don't you remember what happened here?

2447
03:45:51,120 --> 03:45:53,120
This was a fake factory.

2448
03:45:53,120 --> 03:45:57,120
All the machines in this world have a defect somewhere.

2449
03:45:57,120 --> 03:46:00,120
It's going to accumulate like an object.

2450
03:46:00,120 --> 03:46:02,120
I have to get rid of what I have accumulated.

2451
03:46:02,120 --> 03:46:05,120
If I don't do that, it will explode.

2452
03:46:05,120 --> 03:46:09,120
That's where everyone goes out to see unusual things and scary things.

2453
03:46:09,120 --> 03:46:13,120
For example, I see a machine that is disintegrating in front of me.

2454
03:46:13,120 --> 03:46:17,120
The people who are watching are nervous because they feel like they are disintegrating.

2455
03:46:17,120 --> 03:46:20,120
They are nervous because they are being touched.

2456
03:46:20,120 --> 03:46:30,120
But the people who have seen the strange things have increased the purity, the strength, and the production efficiency of white gas.

2457
03:46:30,120 --> 03:46:32,120
That's what it is.

2458
03:46:32,120 --> 03:46:34,120
There were people who fell down from time to time.

2459
03:46:34,120 --> 03:46:37,120
How many times did Pusike disintegrate the machine?

2460
03:46:37,120 --> 03:46:40,120
This device I'm wearing is called the Aura Scope.

2461
03:46:40,120 --> 03:46:43,120
It's a device that communicates with other people's shadows.

2462
03:46:43,120 --> 03:46:47,120
The machine and the shadow that I'm wearing can be deeply mixed.

2463
03:46:47,120 --> 03:46:51,120
Normally, you can only mix it with your own shadow.

2464
03:46:51,120 --> 03:46:54,120
But if you use this, it's a different story.

2465
03:46:54,120 --> 03:46:59,120
So I used this to make the weak shadow disappear into a fake.

2466
03:46:59,120 --> 03:47:02,120
But Pusike didn't use it.

2467
03:47:02,120 --> 03:47:04,120
He's special.

2468
03:47:04,120 --> 03:47:07,120
He's a monster, so you know.

2469
03:47:07,120 --> 03:47:11,120
It's so deep that it destroys the other person's purity.

2470
03:47:13,120 --> 03:47:16,120
Well, I'll give it to you.

2471
03:47:20,120 --> 03:47:22,120
I'll give it to you.

2472
03:47:23,120 --> 03:47:24,120
Goodbye.

2473
03:47:24,120 --> 03:47:26,120
He was weak.

2474
03:47:26,120 --> 03:47:28,120
I should have been able to go.

2475
03:47:28,120 --> 03:47:30,120
I gave him a needle.

2476
03:47:34,120 --> 03:47:36,120
I'll give it to you.

2477
03:47:46,120 --> 03:47:49,120
This is also temporary, but...

2478
03:48:05,120 --> 03:48:08,120
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

2479
03:48:19,120 --> 03:48:22,120
I've gotten used to it.

2480
03:48:26,120 --> 03:48:29,120
I got a juice drink and a strong flame.

2481
03:48:29,120 --> 03:48:32,120
This is the stage water.

2482
03:48:35,120 --> 03:48:38,120
Then...

2483
03:48:38,120 --> 03:48:41,120
I'll give you a silver screen.

2484
03:48:44,120 --> 03:48:48,120
This is the machine that disappears first.

2485
03:48:50,120 --> 03:48:57,120
After this, a lot of machines will disappear.

2486
03:48:57,120 --> 03:49:00,120
This is the dressing room.

2487
03:49:03,120 --> 03:49:06,120
This is the dressing room.

2488
03:49:07,120 --> 03:49:09,120
I'm the two of them.

2489
03:49:09,120 --> 03:49:11,120
Who am I now?

2490
03:49:11,120 --> 03:49:14,120
One of them kills me.

2491
03:49:20,120 --> 03:49:24,120
This is the original version.

2492
03:49:24,120 --> 03:49:27,120
These four lights are lined up.

2493
03:49:27,120 --> 03:49:30,120
There's a key here.

2494
03:49:30,120 --> 03:49:34,120
The lights are just disappearing here.

2495
03:49:34,120 --> 03:49:35,120
It's shiny.

2496
03:49:35,120 --> 03:49:37,120
This is the only hint.

2497
03:49:37,120 --> 03:49:40,120
I got a silver key.

2498
03:49:41,120 --> 03:49:48,120
There were a lot of such hint games in the past.

2499
03:49:49,120 --> 03:50:03,120
There was a device that could control the two press machines and the bridge with the control device of the steam locomotive.

2500
03:50:03,120 --> 03:50:11,120
In the original version, only the numbers 1 and 2 are written there.

2501
03:50:12,120 --> 03:50:18,120
The number 1 and 2 are written in the boiler of the press machine.

2502
03:50:18,120 --> 03:50:21,120
That's the only hint.

2503
03:50:21,120 --> 03:50:25,120
Before that...

2504
03:50:25,120 --> 03:50:29,120
When I was working on Maizumi-san at 23 o'clock,

2505
03:50:29,120 --> 03:50:35,120
I was crushed there and killed for the first time.

2506
03:50:35,120 --> 03:50:43,120
I was left with very little chance to not die there.

2507
03:50:43,120 --> 03:50:47,120
It was a balance like that.

2508
03:50:49,120 --> 03:50:52,120
I usually die.

2509
03:50:54,120 --> 03:50:56,120
It's open.

2510
03:51:00,120 --> 03:51:03,120
This is the stage.

2511
03:51:03,120 --> 03:51:09,120
When you slide up to the Shadow Madashou, the silver key goes down.

2512
03:51:09,120 --> 03:51:13,120
This is actually the fire show.

2513
03:51:13,120 --> 03:51:18,120
There are chains on the top of this blockchain.

2514
03:51:18,120 --> 03:51:24,120
It's like something to slow down the machine.

2515
03:51:25,120 --> 03:51:27,120
It's a terrible place.

2516
03:51:27,120 --> 03:51:29,120
I'm the one who's rushing me.

2517
03:51:29,120 --> 03:51:30,120
I'm the one who's chasing me.

2518
03:51:30,120 --> 03:51:33,120
The body is crumbling.

2519
03:51:33,120 --> 03:51:35,120
I'm the one who's rushing me.

2520
03:51:43,120 --> 03:51:47,120
There's a door from the back.

2521
03:51:47,120 --> 03:51:51,120
This is all from the other side.

2522
03:51:51,120 --> 03:51:55,120
Originally, it was supposed to come out of the dressing room.

2523
03:52:01,120 --> 03:52:05,120
This is the next value.

2524
03:52:05,120 --> 03:52:08,120
055.

2525
03:52:08,120 --> 03:52:10,120
105.

2526
03:52:10,120 --> 03:52:13,120
Information about lava fishing.

2527
03:52:20,120 --> 03:52:22,120
This is Yan's dream.

2528
03:52:22,120 --> 03:52:25,120
There's a frog living in the cave.

2529
03:52:25,120 --> 03:52:29,120
When I walk, the frog roars and crumbles.

2530
03:52:29,120 --> 03:52:31,120
The white organs come out.

2531
03:52:31,120 --> 03:52:32,120
I feel good.

2532
03:52:32,120 --> 03:52:34,120
My chest crumbles.

2533
03:52:34,120 --> 03:52:37,120
I'm a black organ soaked in water.

2534
03:52:37,120 --> 03:52:40,120
It's squeezed and tight.

2535
03:52:40,120 --> 03:52:44,120
The black water comes out from the inside of the organ.

2536
03:52:44,120 --> 03:52:48,120
The black and white organs are mixed together.

2537
03:52:48,120 --> 03:52:50,120
The organ is sharp to get out.

2538
03:52:50,120 --> 03:52:52,120
It's harder.

2539
03:52:52,120 --> 03:52:54,120
And iron, iron.

2540
03:52:54,120 --> 03:52:56,120
I'm an iron man.

2541
03:52:56,120 --> 03:52:58,120
I have to go to Sasarin.

2542
03:52:58,120 --> 03:53:01,120
Somewhere deep in a good place.

2543
03:53:01,120 --> 03:53:03,120
This is Yan's dream.

2544
03:53:03,120 --> 03:53:06,120
Let's read Ju's dream.

2545
03:53:08,120 --> 03:53:10,120
This is Ju's dream.

2546
03:53:10,120 --> 03:53:13,120
Ju hasn't appeared yet.

2547
03:53:13,120 --> 03:53:18,120
It's the body of a machine that comes out later.

2548
03:53:19,120 --> 03:53:22,120
I got it now.

2549
03:53:22,120 --> 03:53:25,120
Dark, dark, dark.

2550
03:53:25,120 --> 03:53:28,120
I'm in between the two walls.

2551
03:53:28,120 --> 03:53:31,120
There's no gap between the walls.

2552
03:53:31,120 --> 03:53:35,120
I can't be in a place like this.

2553
03:53:35,120 --> 03:53:38,120
But I'm sure I'm there.

2554
03:53:38,120 --> 03:53:40,120
I want to think I'm here.

2555
03:53:40,120 --> 03:53:41,120
I draw my body.

2556
03:53:41,120 --> 03:53:43,120
I draw until the blood comes out.

2557
03:53:43,120 --> 03:53:46,120
I draw until it comes out.

2558
03:53:46,120 --> 03:53:47,120
It hurts.

2559
03:53:47,120 --> 03:53:49,120
I'm relieved that it hurts.

2560
03:53:49,120 --> 03:53:50,120
I can see the fat.

2561
03:53:50,120 --> 03:53:51,120
I can see the fat.

2562
03:53:51,120 --> 03:53:52,120
It hurts.

2563
03:53:52,120 --> 03:53:53,120
It hurts.

2564
03:53:53,120 --> 03:53:54,120
It hurts.

2565
03:53:54,120 --> 03:53:55,120
It hurts.

2566
03:53:55,120 --> 03:53:56,120
It hurts.

2567
03:53:56,120 --> 03:53:57,120
It hurts.

2568
03:53:57,120 --> 03:53:58,120
It hurts.

2569
03:53:58,120 --> 03:53:59,120
Someone's coming.

2570
03:53:59,120 --> 03:54:00,120
Who is it?

2571
03:54:00,120 --> 03:54:02,120
Don't bother me.

2572
03:54:02,120 --> 03:54:04,120
Please, please, please.

2573
03:54:04,120 --> 03:54:06,120
Don't come here.

2574
03:54:06,120 --> 03:54:07,120
When I notice,

2575
03:54:07,120 --> 03:54:10,120
my hand is in someone's hand.

2576
03:54:10,120 --> 03:54:12,120
Someone's hand is in my hand.

2577
03:54:12,120 --> 03:54:14,120
When I draw my body,

2578
03:54:14,120 --> 03:54:16,120
it's hot and sticky.

2579
03:54:16,120 --> 03:54:17,120
It's sticky.

2580
03:54:17,120 --> 03:54:18,120
It's sticky.

2581
03:54:18,120 --> 03:54:20,120
I'm pulling the whole body.

2582
03:54:20,120 --> 03:54:22,120
It's sticky and it feels good.

2583
03:54:22,120 --> 03:54:23,120
I'm moving my body.

2584
03:54:23,120 --> 03:54:24,120
It's sticky.

2585
03:54:24,120 --> 03:54:27,120
There are many people who don't have faces.

2586
03:54:27,120 --> 03:54:28,120
You are a caterpillar.

2587
03:54:28,120 --> 03:54:29,120
You are a caterpillar.

2588
03:54:29,120 --> 03:54:30,120
You are a caterpillar.

2589
03:54:30,120 --> 03:54:31,120
Yes, that's right.

2590
03:54:31,120 --> 03:54:32,120
Yes, that's right.

2591
03:54:32,120 --> 03:54:33,120
I'm a caterpillar.

2592
03:54:33,120 --> 03:54:36,120
I thought it would be easier to say.

2593
03:54:36,120 --> 03:54:38,120
Suddenly the floor was slanted.

2594
03:54:38,120 --> 03:54:40,120
I want to eat well.

2595
03:54:40,120 --> 03:54:41,120
It's not slanted.

2596
03:54:41,120 --> 03:54:42,120
It's just heavy.

2597
03:54:42,120 --> 03:54:43,120
I'm sorry.

2598
03:54:43,120 --> 03:54:44,120
I'm sorry.

2599
03:54:44,120 --> 03:54:47,120
No one will forgive me.

2600
03:54:47,120 --> 03:54:49,120
When I drew this,

2601
03:54:49,120 --> 03:54:54,120
I drew it like an automatic sketch.

2602
03:54:54,120 --> 03:55:00,120
I felt like I was in a dream or a place.

2603
03:55:00,120 --> 03:55:05,120
I drew it in an instant without any plans.

2604
03:55:05,120 --> 03:55:07,120
A dream diary.

2605
03:55:07,120 --> 03:55:12,120
Yes.

2606
03:55:12,120 --> 03:55:17,120
I don't care if I lose myself or not myself.

2607
03:55:17,120 --> 03:55:20,120
I don't care about things like that.

2608
03:55:20,120 --> 03:55:27,120
I will come to kill myself.

2609
03:55:27,120 --> 03:55:30,120
I will be killed.

2610
03:55:30,120 --> 03:55:32,120
I am the one who kills me.

2611
03:55:32,120 --> 03:55:36,120
I will get rid of each person.

2612
03:55:36,120 --> 03:55:38,120
In the ending...

2613
03:55:47,020 --> 03:55:49,120
The fish...

2614
03:55:51,620 --> 03:55:53,620
it's Code Line finally...

2615
03:56:06,120 --> 03:56:12,120
There are a lot of them, but I don't think I can catch them all at once.

2616
03:56:16,120 --> 03:56:20,120
I think I can catch at least one of them.

2617
03:56:24,120 --> 03:56:26,120
But...

2618
03:56:36,120 --> 03:56:42,120
There is no hook, and the hook is 0.5, so even if I catch a gedo, I can run away.

2619
03:57:06,120 --> 03:57:10,120
I don't think I can catch a gedo.

2620
03:57:37,120 --> 03:57:45,120
There is no hook, but I can catch a gedo, and the hook is 0.5, so even if I catch a gedo, I can run away.

2621
03:57:45,120 --> 03:57:51,120
There is no hook, and the hook is 0.5, so even if I catch a gedo, I can run away.

2622
03:57:52,120 --> 03:57:58,120
There is no hook, and the hook is 0.5, so even if I catch a gedo, I can run away.

2623
03:58:03,120 --> 03:58:05,120
Did they come?

2624
03:58:09,120 --> 03:58:12,120
Is it a water supply? I don't think so.

2625
03:58:12,120 --> 03:58:14,120
Oh, they came.

2626
03:58:14,120 --> 03:58:16,120
A gedo costs 2,000 yen.

2627
03:58:16,120 --> 03:58:18,120
2,000 times.

2628
03:58:19,120 --> 03:58:23,120
I wonder if there are any other colors.

2629
03:58:31,120 --> 03:58:36,120
Even if there is no hook, sometimes they come, so I can catch them.

2630
03:58:36,120 --> 03:58:40,120
Oh, this looks like a water supply.

2631
03:58:48,120 --> 03:58:52,120
There is no hook, but I can run away.

2632
03:58:52,120 --> 03:58:56,120
I can't get that Gedo.

2633
03:58:56,120 --> 03:59:01,540
A broken text like the previous one

2634
03:59:02,320 --> 03:59:04,380
has no characters,

2635
03:59:05,480 --> 03:59:08,520
no thoughts.

2636
03:59:09,340 --> 03:59:17,640
I answer directly to what this text says,

2637
03:59:17,640 --> 03:59:25,640
The feeling or the place where the person is standing.

2638
03:59:25,640 --> 03:59:27,640
To stand.

2639
03:59:27,640 --> 03:59:29,640
To write.

2640
03:59:36,640 --> 03:59:38,640
How to say.

2641
03:59:39,640 --> 03:59:41,640
It's a state of expression.

2642
03:59:42,640 --> 03:59:44,640
To do so.

2643
03:59:49,640 --> 03:59:52,640
Use physical forces.

2644
03:59:53,640 --> 04:00:00,800
It was said in the

2645
04:00:04,640 --> 04:00:09,640
What about suppressing mental power.

2646
04:00:09,640 --> 04:00:21,640
This time, it was quite difficult to make a scenario for the Juice Route.

2647
04:00:21,640 --> 04:00:47,640
I wrote the scenario of the garage when I was in my thirties, but from then on I lived for more than 20 years, and I thought I had to step on that place again, and it was quite difficult.

2648
04:00:48,640 --> 04:00:57,640
I was cut off from that place, because it was not a good place for people to be.

2649
04:00:57,640 --> 04:01:19,640
After all, the story of the Juice Route is the most difficult, so I had to go to that difficult place to write the story of the Juice Route.

2650
04:01:20,640 --> 04:01:22,640
However, I was able to do it.

2651
04:01:22,640 --> 04:01:25,640
Oh, I can't take it anymore. I wish I could take one more.

2652
04:01:25,640 --> 04:01:53,640
This world itself is originally the inside of the cursed world of a man named Jan, so even when I was about to make this, I had to be prepared for it, so I started on my resolve.

2653
04:01:55,640 --> 04:02:10,640
I was able to get used to the stage 3.

2654
04:02:26,640 --> 04:02:28,640
I was cut off mentally.

2655
04:02:28,640 --> 04:02:30,640
I was able to get used to the stage 3.

2656
04:02:30,640 --> 04:02:33,640
I was able to get used to the stage 3.

2657
04:02:34,640 --> 04:02:40,640
In the end, I was cut off.

2658
04:02:42,640 --> 04:02:47,640
Everyone is cut off in reality to some extent, isn't it?

2659
04:02:48,640 --> 04:03:00,640
In the end, if there is no reality there, nothing will happen, so the creator has to dive.

2660
04:03:03,640 --> 04:03:04,640
Explanation.

2661
04:03:04,640 --> 04:03:06,640
I will increase the output further.

2662
04:03:06,640 --> 04:03:10,640
The parts needed for this stage are 3 oil coolers with a blow-up kit and a reinforced frame.

2663
04:03:10,640 --> 04:03:13,640
At the same time, the water level will also rise.

2664
04:03:13,640 --> 04:03:16,640
If you want to catch a big fish, you should do it.

2665
04:03:16,640 --> 04:03:18,640
I want to catch it.

2666
04:03:23,640 --> 04:03:25,640
Stage 3.

2667
04:03:25,640 --> 04:03:29,640
The water level has improved by 30%.

2668
04:03:33,640 --> 04:03:36,640
Stage 4.

2669
04:03:36,640 --> 04:04:01,240
The

2670
04:04:01,240 --> 04:04:03,240
It is far away from here.

2671
04:04:10,240 --> 04:04:14,240
I have to go to Tsuru-san.

2672
04:04:15,240 --> 04:04:17,240
I have to go to Tsuru-san.

2673
04:04:21,240 --> 04:04:23,240
I want to go to Jako-gan.

2674
04:04:23,240 --> 04:04:25,240
I have to go to Jako-gan.

2675
04:04:31,240 --> 04:04:33,240
I have to go to Tsuru-san.

2676
04:04:47,240 --> 04:04:49,240
I have to go to Jako-gan.

2677
04:04:53,240 --> 04:04:55,240
I have to go to Jako-gan.

2678
04:05:14,240 --> 04:05:16,240
This is Jako-gan.

2679
04:05:16,240 --> 04:05:18,240
This is Jako-gan.

2680
04:05:18,240 --> 04:05:20,240
This is Jako-gan.

2681
04:05:24,240 --> 04:05:32,240
Even if I don't use a frog, I can catch a sea bream.

2682
04:05:32,240 --> 04:05:34,240
I can catch a lot of sea breams.

2683
04:05:44,240 --> 04:05:54,240
I can catch a lot of sea breams.

2684
04:06:03,240 --> 04:06:05,240
I can catch a lot of sea breams.

2685
04:06:20,240 --> 04:06:22,240
I will release my mind.

2686
04:06:28,240 --> 04:06:30,240
I am scared.

2687
04:06:33,240 --> 04:06:35,240
I am scared.

2688
04:06:43,240 --> 04:06:45,240
I am scared.

2689
04:06:46,240 --> 04:06:48,240
I am scared.

2690
04:07:00,240 --> 04:07:02,240
I am scared.

2691
04:07:05,240 --> 04:07:07,240
I have to go to Tsuru-san.

2692
04:07:08,240 --> 04:07:10,240
I have to go to Tsuru-san.

2693
04:07:11,240 --> 04:07:13,240
I have to go to Tsuru-san.

2694
04:07:13,240 --> 04:07:15,240
I have to go to Tsuru-san.

2695
04:07:15,240 --> 04:07:17,240
I have to go to Tsuru-san.

2696
04:07:29,240 --> 04:07:31,240
I have to go to Tsuru-san.

2697
04:07:39,240 --> 04:07:41,240
A female is coming.

2698
04:07:45,240 --> 04:07:47,240
The female is also very good.

2699
04:07:51,240 --> 04:07:53,240
Let's go to Tsuru-san.

2700
04:08:05,240 --> 04:08:07,240
There are a lot of work to do on the horse.

2701
04:08:07,240 --> 04:08:09,240
I have to go to the top.

2702
04:08:10,240 --> 04:08:12,240
It is over 1 o'clock.

2703
04:08:15,240 --> 04:08:30,240
I found it well, so I put on the clothes I put on immediately and improved the efficiency by another 10%.

2704
04:08:30,240 --> 04:08:34,240
It's not bad. No, it's just right. It's not just that it doesn't work yet.

2705
04:08:34,240 --> 04:08:39,240
But I wonder if you are interested in the parts that will be needed first.

2706
04:08:40,240 --> 04:08:46,240
It's a precious product. It's a needle roller bearing, an aluminum die, and a mid-air titanium shaft.

2707
04:08:46,240 --> 04:08:50,240
I've never seen anything like this before.

2708
04:08:50,240 --> 04:08:54,240
Even I've never made this car.

2709
04:08:54,240 --> 04:08:57,240
But if you have these, you should be able to make a car for education.

2710
04:08:57,240 --> 04:09:01,240
I think it's impossible, but if you can find it, I hope you can bring it.

2711
04:09:01,240 --> 04:09:04,240
I got a car parts list.

2712
04:09:05,240 --> 04:09:11,240
When I think about the juice, what I'm doing seems so small.

2713
04:09:11,240 --> 04:09:15,240
I've been crushed by that feeling many times.

2714
04:09:15,240 --> 04:09:20,240
But a good car gives us a little freedom.

2715
04:09:20,240 --> 04:09:24,240
It's a small thing, but there's a difference between a world that has it and a world that doesn't.

2716
04:09:24,240 --> 04:09:30,240
No, it doesn't matter what the difference is. I want to do what I can.

2717
04:09:35,240 --> 04:09:39,240
It's surprisingly realistic.

2718
04:09:39,240 --> 04:09:44,240
M3, juice, that girl was a terrible girl, but I'm sure she's not a bad girl.

2719
04:09:44,240 --> 04:09:49,240
No one is bad. There was something missing.

2720
04:09:49,240 --> 04:09:55,240
I don't care who it is. I don't care who it is.

2721
04:10:04,240 --> 04:10:08,240
Let's hear from Newmo.

2722
04:10:08,240 --> 04:10:12,240
Newmo, don't you want to find out about your dream diary?

2723
04:10:12,240 --> 04:10:15,240
It's not a big secret.

2724
04:10:15,240 --> 04:10:21,240
You probably don't know, but I feel like I'm going to lose my virginity.

2725
04:10:21,240 --> 04:10:25,240
I'm scared. I can't stand the fear of being a bad guy.

2726
04:10:25,240 --> 04:10:29,240
I'm going to forget everyone. I'm going to be sealed.

2727
04:10:29,240 --> 04:10:32,240
I'm fine.

2728
04:10:34,240 --> 04:10:37,240
I'm sorry.

2729
04:10:40,240 --> 04:10:45,240
I'm going to walk my own path.

2730
04:10:46,240 --> 04:10:48,240
I want to pick some.

2731
04:10:48,240 --> 04:10:51,240
Don't you have a lot of things? can you pick one?

2732
04:10:51,240 --> 04:10:54,240
I want to pick one.

2733
04:10:54,240 --> 04:10:57,240
I'm glad. If you like, please take this.

2734
04:10:57,240 --> 04:11:02,240
I'm talking about you to Mr. Hanimitsu.

2735
04:11:02,240 --> 04:11:08,240
That person doesn't answer anything, but even if you just speak, it feels a little refreshing.

2736
04:11:08,240 --> 04:11:10,240
It's a strange thing, isn't it?

2737
04:11:11,240 --> 04:11:13,240
What? What?

2738
04:11:13,240 --> 04:11:17,240
You're laughing, but there's no way it's Pusike's dream.

2739
04:11:17,240 --> 04:11:20,240
Pusike is just a dream.

2740
04:11:20,240 --> 04:11:25,240
Tsuru-san, you know surprisingly deep things, don't you?

2741
04:11:27,240 --> 04:11:30,240
You know about the shadows, too.

2742
04:11:33,240 --> 04:11:36,240
Okay, what's left is...

2743
04:11:37,240 --> 04:11:40,240
I'll let you know.

2744
04:11:40,240 --> 04:11:45,340
out.

2745
04:12:03,340 --> 04:12:07,320
Having said this, there are various things.

2746
04:12:07,700 --> 04:12:09,480
That was another account.

2747
04:12:15,120 --> 04:12:17,380
Everything else on that run?

2748
04:12:26,580 --> 04:12:28,320
I passed it.

2749
04:12:31,960 --> 04:12:35,140
This has only one RC car.

2750
04:12:37,320 --> 04:12:38,320
Here?

2751
04:12:40,320 --> 04:12:42,320
I know this place.

2752
04:12:47,320 --> 04:12:49,320
Let's go to the bathroom.

2753
04:13:08,320 --> 04:13:10,320
Use room 8.

2754
04:13:11,320 --> 04:13:16,320
If you can't find it, it's a machine called Chen.

2755
04:13:16,320 --> 04:13:19,320
It's probably a dream machine.

2756
04:13:19,320 --> 04:13:21,320
It can only appear at a certain time.

2757
04:13:21,320 --> 04:13:24,320
I can tell right away because I have a strange device in my eyes.

2758
04:13:24,320 --> 04:13:26,320
I got the key to room 8.

2759
04:13:28,320 --> 04:13:31,320
I went a long way.

2760
04:13:32,320 --> 04:13:36,320
Let's go to room 8.

2761
04:13:52,320 --> 04:13:54,320
I arrived.

2762
04:14:01,320 --> 04:14:03,320
I'm a little lazy.

2763
04:14:03,320 --> 04:14:05,320
I'm lazy in this world, too.

2764
04:14:05,320 --> 04:14:07,320
It's a waste.

2765
04:14:07,320 --> 04:14:09,320
The old one is also a dream machine.

2766
04:14:10,320 --> 04:14:12,320
Is it only 3?

2767
04:14:13,320 --> 04:14:24,320
1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

2768
04:14:24,320 --> 04:14:27,320
Room 3 is a castle in the Malaya Palace.

2769
04:14:27,320 --> 04:14:29,320
A palace.

2770
04:14:29,320 --> 04:14:33,320
I was told to come here.

2771
04:14:42,320 --> 04:15:01,320
I like the quest content of Fushike no Yume Nikki no Shoun.

2772
04:15:01,320 --> 04:15:20,320
I like the quest content of Fushike no Yume Nikki no Shoun.

2773
04:15:31,320 --> 04:15:41,320
I like the quest content of Fushike no Yume Nikki no Shoun.

2774
04:16:01,320 --> 04:16:21,320
I like the quest content of Fushike no Yume Nikki no Shoun.

2775
04:16:31,320 --> 04:16:51,320
I like the quest content of Fushike no Yume Nikki no Shoun.

2776
04:16:51,320 --> 04:17:01,320
I'm glad I was able to sleep well today.

2777
04:17:31,320 --> 04:17:41,320
I don't think I've ever written Fushike no Yume Nikki.

2778
04:17:41,320 --> 04:17:51,320
I don't think I've ever written Fushike no Yume Nikki.

2779
04:17:52,320 --> 04:17:56,320
I'm going to wake up now.

2780
04:17:56,320 --> 04:18:01,320
I'm going to wake up now.

2781
04:18:01,320 --> 04:18:05,320
I'm going to wake up now.

2782
04:18:22,320 --> 04:18:27,320
What I haven't talked about is...

2783
04:18:45,320 --> 04:18:47,320
Bye-bye.

2784
04:18:52,320 --> 04:18:56,320
I'm in the middle of the night.

2785
04:18:56,320 --> 04:18:59,320
I'm in the middle of the night.

2786
04:19:01,320 --> 04:19:04,320
I can't even talk to you.

2787
04:19:04,320 --> 04:19:09,320
I'm in the middle of the night.

2788
04:19:28,320 --> 04:19:31,320
Fushike no Yume Nikki.

2789
04:19:31,320 --> 04:19:35,320
this way.

2790
04:19:50,320 --> 04:19:51,320
The diary.

2791
04:19:51,320 --> 04:19:53,320
It is a strange thing.

2792
04:19:53,320 --> 04:19:55,320
I don't remember anyone writing it.

2793
04:19:55,320 --> 04:19:59,320
There is no light that writes a diary now.

2794
04:19:59,320 --> 04:20:02,320
It used to be popular.

2795
04:20:02,320 --> 04:20:05,320
Of course, I didn't write it because I wanted to write it.

2796
04:20:05,320 --> 04:20:07,320
When I realized it, it was right in front of me.

2797
04:20:07,320 --> 04:20:10,320
It was like a fever.

2798
04:20:10,320 --> 04:20:17,320
I don't know why the dream diary is popular when the church disappears.

2799
04:20:17,320 --> 04:20:21,320
There are a lot of things I don't know about this world.

2800
04:20:21,320 --> 04:20:23,320
It's not just a dream diary.

2801
04:20:23,320 --> 04:20:27,320
It's not strange that something really crazy happened.

2802
04:20:29,320 --> 04:20:33,820
That means we can't talk about the meetings, right?

2803
04:20:39,820 --> 04:20:42,320
Let's see.

2804
04:20:44,320 --> 04:20:49,320
I don't think he will talk about the meetings.

2805
04:20:52,320 --> 04:20:54,320
No, but...

2806
04:20:54,320 --> 04:21:06,320
There was a boy named Zeus, a boy who suddenly talked to me.

2807
04:21:06,320 --> 04:21:10,320
He was small, but he was a good boy.

2808
04:21:10,320 --> 04:21:16,320
He was standing in front of me, and I thought he would be sucked into me and disappear.

2809
04:21:17,320 --> 04:21:22,320
When he came in front of me, he looked like he didn't want to be sucked into me.

2810
04:21:22,320 --> 04:21:25,320
He was black and scary.

2811
04:21:25,320 --> 04:21:29,320
If he was sucked into me, he would never come out again.

2812
04:21:29,320 --> 04:21:32,320
When I thought that, I couldn't see his eyes.

2813
04:21:33,320 --> 04:21:39,320
He was the only person who could talk to me.

2814
04:21:39,320 --> 04:21:45,320
He was the only person who could talk to me.

2815
04:22:03,320 --> 04:22:07,320
He was the only person who could talk to me.

2816
04:22:21,320 --> 04:22:23,320
I don't need a battery.

2817
04:22:33,320 --> 04:22:37,320
I'm going to the place where the battery is.

2818
04:22:37,320 --> 04:22:42,320
I want to go to the battery because I don't want to be sucked into me.

2819
04:22:55,320 --> 04:23:00,320
I'm going to the place where the battery is.

2820
04:23:00,320 --> 04:23:09,800
Then go to the rookreef.

2821
04:23:30,320 --> 04:23:32,320
Okay.

2822
04:23:37,080 --> 04:23:38,760
Okay.

2823
04:23:42,100 --> 04:23:44,100
OK.

2824
04:23:45,920 --> 04:23:52,480
Let's go to the lake.

2825
04:24:00,320 --> 04:24:12,320
please subscribe my channel

2826
04:24:12,320 --> 04:24:24,320
It is interesting to me that I take care ofıt to him.

2827
04:24:24,320 --> 04:24:39,320
Thank you. The chain seems to have been broken. I felt that the purity of the chain was deteriorating.

2828
04:24:39,320 --> 04:24:44,320
Everyone is breaking. The sound of desire, the dance of desire.

2829
04:24:44,320 --> 04:24:49,320
I felt your shadow. It's a water tower under the building.

2830
04:24:49,320 --> 04:24:53,320
You can go if you have a boat from the Hyakka store.

2831
04:24:53,320 --> 04:24:55,320
Do you understand?

2832
04:24:55,320 --> 04:24:57,320
Yes.

2833
04:24:57,320 --> 04:25:00,320
I'm looking for a boat.

2834
04:25:00,320 --> 04:25:08,320
Well, that's it for today.

2835
04:25:08,320 --> 04:25:15,320
I will continue tomorrow.

2836
04:25:15,320 --> 04:25:25,320
I'm sorry that the frame I took the first time couldn't be continued.

2837
04:25:25,320 --> 04:25:36,320
If I had left the delivery software open, it would have been invalid, and it would have ended in an instant.

2838
04:25:36,320 --> 04:25:45,320
I'm sorry. I'm sorry to have confused you.

2839
04:25:45,320 --> 04:25:52,320
I'll do it again tomorrow. Thank you for coming.

2840
04:25:52,320 --> 04:25:58,320
See you again.
